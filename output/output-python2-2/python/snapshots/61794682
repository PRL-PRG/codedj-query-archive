def Family(indices, function = None, name = None, hidden_keys = [], hidden_function = None):
    r"""
    A Family is an associative container which models a family
    (f_i)_{i in I}. Then, f[i] returns the element of the family
    indexed by i. Whenever available, set and combinatorial class
    operations (counting, iteration, listing) on the family are
    induced from those of the index set.

    There are several available implementations (classes) for
    different usages; Family serves as a factory, and will create
    instances of the appropriate classes depending on its arguments.

    EXAMPLES:

        In its simplest form, a list l by itself is considered as the
        family $(l[i]_{i in I})$ where $I$ is the range $0\dots,len(l)$.
        So Family(l) just returns it.

            sage: f = Family([1,2,3])
            sage: f
            [1, 2, 3]

        A family can also be constructed from a dictionary t. The
        resulting family is very close to t, except that the elements
        of the family are the values of t. Here, we define the family
        (f_i)_{i in \{3,4,7\}} with f_3='a', f_4='b', and f_7='d':

            sage: f = Family({3: 'a', 4: 'b', 7: 'd'})
            sage: f
            Finite family {3: 'a', 4: 'b', 7: 'd'}
            sage: f[7]
            'd'
            sage: len(f)
            3
            sage: list(f)
            ['a', 'b', 'd']
            sage: [ x for x in f ]
            ['a', 'b', 'd']
            sage: f.keys()
            [3, 4, 7]
            sage: 'b' in f       # todo: not implemented
            True
            sage: 'e' in f       # todo: not implemented
            False

        A familly can also be constructed by its index set $I$ and a
        function $f$, as in $(f(i))_{i in I}$:

            sage: f = Family([3,4,7], lambda i: 2*i)
            sage: f
            Finite family {3: 6, 4: 8, 7: 14}
            sage: f.keys()
            [3, 4, 7]
            sage: f[7]
            14
            sage: list(f)
            [6, 8, 14]
            sage: [ x for x in f]
            [6, 8, 14]
            sage: len(f)
            3

        By default, if the index set is a list, all images are
        computed right away, and stored in an internal
        dictionary. Note that this requires all the elements of the
        list to be hashable. One can ask instead for the images $f(i)$
        to be computed lazily, when needed:

            sage: f = LazyFamily([3,4,7], lambda i: 2*i)
            sage: f
            Lazy family (f(i))_{i in [3, 4, 7]}
            sage: f[7]
            14
            sage: list(f)
            [6, 8, 14]
            sage: [ x for x in f]
            [6, 8, 14]
            sage: len(f)
            3

        This allows in particular for modeling infinite families:
            sage: f = Family(ZZ, lambda i: 2*i)
            sage: f
            Lazy family (f(i))_{i in Integer Ring}
            sage: f.keys()
            Integer Ring
            sage: f[1]
            2
            sage: f[-5]
            -10
            sage: i = f.__iter__()
            sage: i.next(), i.next(), i.next(), i.next(), i.next()
            (0, 2, -2, 4, -4)

        Caveat: families with lazy behavior cannot be pickled


        Finally, it can occasionally be useful to add some hidden
        elements in a familly, which are accessible as f[i], but
        do not appear in the keys or the container operations.

            sage: f = Family([3,4,7], lambda i: 2*i, hidden_keys=[2])
            sage: f
            Finite family {3: 6, 4: 8, 7: 14}
            sage: f.keys()
            [3, 4, 7]
            sage: f.hidden_keys()
            [2]
            sage: f[7]
            14
            sage: f[2]
            4
            sage: list(f)
            [6, 8, 14]
            sage: [ x for x in f]
            [6, 8, 14]
            sage: len(f)
            3

        The following example illustrates when the function is actually called:
            sage: def compute_value(i):
            ...       print('computing 2*'+str(i))
            ...       return 2*i
            sage: f = Family([3,4,7], compute_value, hidden_keys=[2])
            computing 2*3
            computing 2*4
            computing 2*7
            sage: f
            Finite family {3: 6, 4: 8, 7: 14}
            sage: f.keys()
            [3, 4, 7]
            sage: f.hidden_keys()
            [2]
            sage: f[7]
            14
            sage: f[2]
            computing 2*2
            4
            sage: f[2]
            4
            sage: list(f)
            [6, 8, 14]
            sage: [ x for x in f]
            [6, 8, 14]
            sage: len(f)
            3

        Here is a close variant where the function for the hidden keys
        is different from that for the other keys:

            sage: f = Family([3,4,7], lambda i: 2*i, hidden_keys=[2], hidden_function = lambda i: 3*i)
            sage: f
            Finite family {3: 6, 4: 8, 7: 14}
            sage: f.keys()
            [3, 4, 7]
            sage: f.hidden_keys()
            [2]
            sage: f[7]
            14
            sage: f[2]
            6
            sage: list(f)
            [6, 8, 14]
            sage: [ x for x in f]
            [6, 8, 14]
            sage: len(f)
            3

        Family behaves the same way with FiniteCombinatorialClass
        instances and lists.  This feature will eventually disapear
        when FiniteCombinatorialClass won't be needed anymore.
        
            sage: f = Family(FiniteCombinatorialClass([1,2,3]))
            sage: f
            Combinatorial class with elements in [1, 2, 3]

            sage: f = Family(FiniteCombinatorialClass([3,4,7]), lambda i: 2*i)
            sage: f
            Finite family {3: 6, 4: 8, 7: 14}
            sage: f.keys()
            [3, 4, 7]
            sage: f[7]
            14
            sage: list(f)
            [6, 8, 14]
            sage: [ x for x in f]
