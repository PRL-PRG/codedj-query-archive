"""Inference engine to write times in English (or other language).

Change the rules to adapt to another language. Caution: the rule parser does not
strictly check the syntax and many errors will remained ignored.

Usefull functions:
- print_rules(): Dump the set of rules.
- test_times(): Try to print all times from 00:00 to 23:59.
- write_time(hour, minute): Write the (hour, minute) in natural language.
- eval_rule(text): Translate the text according to the set of rules.

Example of usage:
-----------------
import timewriter

w = timewriter.TimeWriter("en")
s = w.write_time(2, 33)
print "It is %s."

prints --> It is thirty-three minutes past two in the morning.

    # The left hand side of the rule defines a pattern with a variable 'h' and a

    # the first rule matching hour(h) after substituting the variable 'h' by its value,

    # Internal spaces are significant on the right side of a rule. In calls, all
    # arguments which are not numbers are considered to be variables. The rule parser
    # is very simple and will let many syntax errors go ignored.
    #
    # A rule ends with the character '|'.
    # The character '_' is a anonymous variable.

    #     plural(1) => |
    #     plural(_) => s |
    #     hour(h) => number(h) hour#plural(h) |
    # Use '\#' to use a # character, for instance in a pango color

    # You can put range conditions on firing a rule, with the syntax [var1 < var2] or
    # [var1 < var2 < var3]. For instance:
    #     hours(h) [h < 12] => in the morning |
    #     hours(h) [12 < h < 18] => in the afternoon |
    #     hours(_) => in the night |
