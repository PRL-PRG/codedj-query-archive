Graphics file converters.

Each module in this package describes the operation of a particular external
utility that can be used to convert graphics files between formats. This root
module contains a table that contains the name of the module to be used in
each case.

TODO: this file must know about installed modules, it lacks the flexibility of
the main module system.
