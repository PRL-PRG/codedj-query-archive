This file was automatically generated by the PyLR parser generator.
It defines the tables 'actiontable', 'gototable', and 'prodinfo'.  These 
tables are used to give functionality to a parsing engine.  It also defines
A Parser class called SimpleParser which will use this engine.  It's usage
is indicated in SimpleParser's doc-string.
