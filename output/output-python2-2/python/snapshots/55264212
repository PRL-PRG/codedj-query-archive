Base classes for creating commands and handlers.

This module exports several important base classes:

    BaseData - The base abstract class for all data objects.

    BaseHandler - The base abstract class from which versioned kickstart
                  syntax handlers are derived.

    DeprecatedCommand - A concrete subclass of KickstartCommand that should
                        be further subclassed by users of this module.  When
                        a subclass is used, a warning message will be
                        printed.

    KickstartCommand - The base abstract class for all kickstart commands.
