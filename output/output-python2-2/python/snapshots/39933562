"""PooledPg - pooling for classic PyGreSQL connections.

Implements a pool of solid, thread-safe cached connections
to a PostgreSQL database which are transparently reused,
using the classic (not DB-API 2 compliant) PyGreSQL API.

This should result in a speedup for persistent applications such as the
application server of "Webware for Python," without loss of robustness.

Robustness is provided by using "hardened" SolidPg connections.
Even if the underlying database is restarted and all connections
are lost, they will be automatically and transparently reopened.

Measures are taken to make the pool of connections thread-safe
regardless of the fact that the classic PyGreSQL pg module itself
is not thread-safe at the connection level.

Usage:

First you need to set up the database connection pool by creating
an instance of PooledPg, passing the following parameters:

	mincached: the initial number of connections in the pool
		(the default of 0 means no connections are made at startup)
	maxcached: the maximum number of connections in the pool
		(the default value of 0 means unlimited pool size)
	maxconnections: maximum number of connections generally allowed
		(the default value of 0 means any number of connections)
	blocking: determines behavior when exceeding the maximum
		(the default of 0 or False means report an error; otherwise
		block and wait until the number of connections decreases)
	maxusage: maximum number of reuses of a single connection
		(the default of 0 or False means unlimited reuse)
		When this maximum usage number of the connection is reached,
		the connection is automatically reset (closed and reopened).
	setsession: an optional list of SQL commands that may serve to
		prepare the session, e.g. ["set datestyle to german", ...]

	Additionally, you have to pass the parameters for the actual
	PostgreSQL connection which are passed via PyGreSQL,
	such as the names of the host, database, user, password etc.

For instance, if you want a pool of at least five connections
to your local database 'mydb':

	from PooledPg import PooledPg
	pool = PooledPg(5, dbname='mydb')

Once you have set up the connection pool you can request
database connections from that pool:

	db = pool.connection()

You can use these connections just as if they were ordinary
classic PyGreSQL API connections. Actually what you get is a
proxy class for the hardened SolidPg version of the connection.

The connection will not be shared with other threads. If you don't need
it any more, you should immediately return it to the pool with db.close().
You can get another connection in the same way or with db.reopen().


Ideas for improvement:

* Add thread for monitoring and restarting bad or expired connections
(similar to DBConnectionPool/ResourcePool by Warren Smith).
* Optionally log usage, bad connections and exceeding of limits.
