    Create a matrix.

    INPUT:
    Supported formats
        1. matrix([sparse]):
               the 0x0 matrix over ZZ
        2. matrix(list_of_rows, [sparse]):
               matrix with each row constructed from the list_of_rows
        3. matrix(nrows, entries, [sparse]):
               matrix with given number of rows and flat list of entries 
        4. matrix(nrows, ncols, entries, [sparse]):
               matrix with given number of rows and columns with flat list of entries
        5. matrix(ring, list_of_row, [sparse]):
               matrix over ring with rows the elements of the list_of_rows
        6. matrix(ring, nrows, entries, [sparse]):
               matrix over ring with given number of rows and entries from the flat list
        7. matrix(ring, nrows, ncols, entries, [sparse]):
               matrix over the given ring with given number of rows and columns and entries.
        
    In each case the sparse option is optional, must be explicitly named (i.e., sparse=True),
    and may be either True or false.

    OUTPUT:
        a matrix

    EXAMPLES:
    1. The degenerate matrix input format:
        sage: m = matrix(); m
        []
        sage: parent(m)
        Full MatrixSpace of 0 by 0 dense matrices over Integer Ring
        sage: m = matrix(sparse=True); m
        []
        sage: parent(m)
        Full MatrixSpace of 0 by 0 sparse matrices over Integer Ring
        
    2. The "matrix(list_of_rows, [sparse])" input format.
       Notice that SAGE is careful to find a sensible common
       ring for all the entries (using the Sequence object):

        sage: m = matrix([[1/3,2+x],[3,4]]); m
        [  1/3 x + 2]
        [    3     4]
        sage: parent(m)
        Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 dense matrices over Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
        
        sage: m = matrix([[1,2],[3,4/7]]); m
        [  1   2]
        [  3 4/7]
        sage: parent(m)
        Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 dense matrices over Rational Field
        
        sage: m = matrix([[1,2,3], [RDF(2), CDF(1,2), 3]]); m
        [        1.0         2.0         3.0]
        [        2.0 1.0 + 2.0*I         3.0]
        sage: parent(m)
        Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 3 dense matrices over Complex Double Field

        sage: V = GF(7)^2
        sage: m = matrix([V.0, V.0+2*V.1], sparse=True); m
        [1 0]
        [1 2]
        sage: parent(m)
        Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 sparse matrices over Finite Field of size 7

    3. matrix(nrows, entries, [sparse]):

        [  1   2]
        [3/4 5/6]
        [7*x 8*x]

    The number of rows must divide the number of entries. 
        sage: matrix(5,[1,2,3, 4,5,6])
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        TypeError: entries has the wrong length

    4. matrix(nrows, ncols, entries, [sparse]):
        sage: matrix(2,3, [1,2,3, 4,5,6])
        [1 2 3]
        [4 5 6]
        sage: matrix(3,2, [1,2,  3/4, 5/6, 7*x, 8*x])
        [  1   2]
        [3/4 5/6]
        [7*x 8*x]

    The length of the entry list must be the same as the number of rows times columns.
        sage: matrix(3,3, [1,2,  3/4, 5/6, 7*x, 8*x])
