A collection of constructors of common graphs.

USES:
    A list of all graphs and graph structures in this database is
    available via tab completion. Type "graphs." and then hit tab to see
    which graphs are available.

    The docstrings include educational information about each named graph
    with the hopes that this database can be used as a reference.

PLOTTING:
    All graphs (i.e., networks) have an associated SAGE graphics object,
    which you can display:
        
        sage: G = WheelGraph(15)
        sage: p = G.plot()
        sage: is_Graphics(p)
        True

    When creating a graph in SAGE, the default positioning of nodes is
    determined using the spring-layout algorithm.  Often, it is more
    efficient to pre-set the positions in a dictionary.  Additionally, we
    can use this position dictionary to display the graph in an intuitive
    manner, whereas the spring-layout would fail if the graph is not very
    symmetric.  For example, consider the Petersen graph with default node
    positioning vs. the Petersen graph constructed by this database:

        sage: petersen_spring = Graph({0:[1,4,5], 1:[0,2,6], 2:[1,3,7], 3:[2,4,8], 4:[0,3,9],\
                5:[0,7,8], 6:[1,8,9], 7:[2,5,9], 8:[3,5,6], 9:[4,6,7]})
        sage.: petersen_spring.show()
        sage: petersen_database = graphs.PetersenGraph()
        sage.: petersen_database.show()
    
    For all the constructors in this database (except the random and
    empty graphs), the position dictionary is filled, instead of using the
    spring-layout algorithm.

ORGANIZATION:
    The constructors available in this database are organized as follows:

            - EmptyGraph

    def EmptyGraph(self):

        Returns an empty graph (0 nodes and 0 edges).
        
        This is useful for constructing graphs by adding edges and
        vertices individually or in a loop.  
        
        PLOTTING:
        When plotting, this graph will use the default spring-layout
        algorithm, unless a position dictionary is specified.

        return graph.Graph()
        
    def CycleGraph(self, n):
        r"""
        Returns a cycle graph with n nodes.
        
        A cycle graph is a basic structure which is also typically called
        an n-gon.
        
        This constructor is dependant on vertices numbered 0 through n-1
        in NetworkX \code{cycle_graph()}
        
        PLOTTING:
        Upon construction, the position dictionary is filled to override
        the spring-layout algorithm. By convention, each cycle graph will
        be displayed with the first (0) node at the top, with the rest
        following in a counterclockwise manner.
        
        The cycle graph is a good opportunity to compare efficiency of
        filling a position dictionary vs. using the spring-layout algorithm
        for plotting.  Because the cycle graph is very symmetric, the
        resulting plots should be similar (in cases of small n).
        
        Filling the position dictionary in advance adds O(n) to the
        constructor.  Feel free to race the constructors below in the
        examples section.  The much larger difference is the time added
        by the spring-layout algorithm when plotting.  (Also shown in the
        example below).  The spring  model is typically described as O(n^3),
        as appears to be the case in the NetworkX source code.
        
        EXAMPLES:

        This constructor is dependant on NetworkX numeric labels.
        
        PLOTTING:
        Upon construction, the position dictionary is filled to override
        the spring-layout algorithm. By convention, each star graph will
        be displayed with the first (0) node in the center, the second
        node (1) at the top, with the rest following in a counterclockwise
        manner.  (0) is the node connected to all other nodes.
        
        The star graph is a good opportunity to compare efficiency of
        filling a position dictionary vs. using the spring-layout algorithm
        for plotting.  As far as display, the spring-layout should push all
        other nodes away from the (0) node, and thus look very similar to
        this constructor's positioning.

        we see that this graph is not very symmetric and thus the display
        may not be very meaningful. Efficiency of construction and plotting
        is not an issue, as the Petersen graph only has 10 vertices and 14
        edges.
        
        Our labeling convention here is to start on the outer pentagon from
        the top, moving counterclockwise. Then the nodes on the inner star,
        starting at the top and moving counterclockwise.

    def CompleteGraph(self, n):
        """
        Returns a complete graph on n nodes.
        
        A Complete Graph is a graph in which all nodes are connected to all
        other nodes.
        
        This constructor is dependant on vertices numbered 0 through n-1 in
        NetworkX complete_graph()
        
        PLOTTING:
        Upon construction, the position dictionary is filled to override
        the spring-layout algorithm. By convention, each complete graph
        will be displayed with the first (0) node at the top, with the
        rest following in a counterclockwise manner.
        
        In the complete graph, there is a big difference visually in using
        the spring-layout algorithm vs. the position dictionary used in
        this constructor.  The position dictionary flattens the graph,
        making it clear which nodes an edge is connected to.  But the
        complete graph offers a good example of how the spring-layout
        works.  The edges push outward (everything is connected), causing
        the graph to appear as a 3-dimensional pointy ball.  (See examples
        below).
        
        Filling the position dictionary in advance adds O(n) to the
        constructor.  Feel free to race the constructors below in the
        examples section.  The much larger difference is the time added
        by the spring-layout algorithm when plotting.  (Also shown in the
        example below).  The spring model is typically described as O(n^3),
        as appears to be the case in the NetworkX source code.

        nodes [0,(n1-1)] connected to each of the nodes [n1,(n2-1)] and
        vice versa.
        
        A Complete Bipartite Graph is a graph with its vertices partitioned
        into two groups, V1 and V2.  Each v in V1 is connected to every v
        in V2, and vice versa.  
        
        PLOTTING:
        Upon construction, the position dictionary is filled to override
        the spring-layout algorithm. By convention, each complete bipartite
        graph will be displayed with the first n1 nodes on the top row (at
        y=1) from left to right.  The remaining n2 nodes appear at y=0,
        also from left to right.  The shorter row (partition with fewer
        nodes) is stretched to the same length as the longer row, unless
        the shorter row has 1 node; in which case it is centered.  The x
        values in the plot are in domain [0,max{n1,n2}].  
                
        In the Complete Bipartite graph, there is a visual difference in
        using the spring-layout algorithm vs. the position dictionary used
        in this constructor.  The position dictionary flattens the graph
        and separates the partitioned nodes, making it clear which nodes
        an edge is connected to.  The Complete Bipartite graph plotted with
        the spring-layout algorithm tends to center the nodes in n1 (see
        spring_med in examples below), thus overlapping its nodes and edges,
        making it typically hard to decipher.
        
        Filling the position dictionary in advance adds O(n) to the
        constructor.  Feel free to race the constructors below in the
