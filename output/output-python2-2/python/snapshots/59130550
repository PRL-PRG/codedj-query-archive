`sprl` is a "schema environment", that is, set of tables that are
designed so that they can live together and co-operate.

Although "sprl" comes from "société privéee à responsabilité limitée",
the sprl package is not limited to applications for small and medium
companies.

sprl is currently the only schema environment, and future will tell
whether there will be more environments.
