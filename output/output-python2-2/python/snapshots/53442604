    """This class is intended to make it easier to program applications with many screens:
    
    1. The programmer should not now select which 'Form' to display himself.  Instead, he should set the NEXT_ACTIVE_FORM class variable.  
       See the registerForm method for details.
       
       Doing this will avoid accidentally exceeding the maximum recursion depth.  Forms themselves should be placed under the management
       of the class using the 'addFrom' method.
       
    2. Forms that are managed by this class can access a proxy to the parent application through their ".parentApp" attribute, which is
       created by this class.
       
    3. a Optionally, Forms managed by this class may be given an .activate method, which will be called instead of their .edit loop
       
       b If not given an .activate method, any .afterEditing method which a form possesses will be called after .edit() has exited.  
         3b is the preferred method to change NEXT_ACTIVE_FORM
         
    4. The method onInMainLoop is called after each screen has exited. This can be overridden. 
    
    5. This method should be able to see which screen was last active using the self._LAST_NEXT_ACTIVE_FORM attribute, which is only set
       just before each screen is displayed.
       
    6. Unless you override the attribute STARTING_FORM, the first form to be called should be named 'MAIN'
    
    7. Do override the onStart and onCleanExit functions if you wish.
