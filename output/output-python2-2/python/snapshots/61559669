class Cryptosystem(parent_old.Parent, Set_generic):
      r"""
      A cryptosystem is a pair of maps 
      $$
      E : {\mathcal K} \rightarrow {\rm Hom}({\mathcal M},{\mathcal C})
      $$
      $$
      D : {\mathcal K} \rightarrow {\rm Hom}({\mathcal C},{\mathcal M})
      $$
      where ${\mathcal K}$ is the keyspace, ${\mathcal M}$ is the plaintext 
      or message space, and ${\mathcal C}$ is the ciphertext space. 
      In many instances ${\mathcal M} = {\mathcal C}$ and the images will 
      lie in ${\rm Aut}({\mathcal M})$. An element of the image of $E$ is 
      called a cipher.

      We may assume that $E$ and $D$ are injective, hence identify a key $K$
      in ${\mathcal K}$ with its image $E_K := E(K)$ in 
      $\Hom({\mathcal M},{\mathcal C})$.

      The cryptosystem has the property that for every encryption key $K_1$
      there is a decryption key $K_2$ such that $D_{K_2} \circ E_{K_1}$.
      A cryptosystem with the property that $K := K_2 = K_1$, is called a 
      symmetric cryptosystem.  Otherwise, if the key $K_2 \ne K_1$, nor is 
      $K_2$ easily derived from $K_1$, we call the cryptosystem asymmetric 
      of public key.  In that case, $K_1$ is called the public key and $K_2$
      is called the private key.
