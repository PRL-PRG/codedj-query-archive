"""A simple captcha to allow anonymous ticket changes as long as the user solves
a math problem.

I thought that the ITicketManipulator prepare_ticket method would be the place
to add extra HTML stuff to the ticket page, but it seems to be for future use
only.  The only way I found that I could add to the HTML was by modifying the
Genshi template using the ITemplateStreamFilter.

I looked at http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/BlackMagicTicketTweaksPlugin for help
trying to understand how the Genshi transformation stuff worked.
