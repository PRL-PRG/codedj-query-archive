Modular forms with character over a finite field just breaks:

   sage: m = ModularForms(DirichletGroup(8).1,2,GF(7)); m
   Modular Forms space of dimension 2, character [1, -1] and weight 2 over Finite Field of size 7
   sage: m.basis()   # this just goes into infinite loop (???)
   boom


This is not implemented yet, but needs to be.
   sage: ModularForms(DirichletGroup(13, GF(7)).0^6,3).base_ring()
   Finite Field of size 7
