    DistributedSage allows you to do distributed computing in SAGE.

    To get up and running quickly, run dsage.setup() to run the configuration
    utility.
    Note that configuration files will be stored in DOT_SAGE/dsage

    There are three distinct parts of Distributed SAGE:
        Server
            Launch the server with dsage.server()
        Worker
            Launch the worker with dsage.worker()
        Client
            Create the DSage object like this:
                d = DSage()
    
    Examples:
        This starts a server instance on localhost

        sage: dsage.server()
        This is currently blocking

        Open another sage instance and type

        sage: dsage.worker() 

        This starts a worker connecting the localhost

        Open yet another terminal and type:

        sage: D = DSage()

        This creates a connection to the remote server.  To do a simple
        evaluation, type:

        sage: job1 = D('2+2')

        This sends the job 'print 2+2' to a worker and you can view the 
        result by typing:

        sage: print job1

        This is the most basic way of interacting with dsage. To do more 
        complicated tasks, you should look at the DistributedFunction class. 
        For example, to do distributed integer factorization with ECM, type 
        this:

        sage: f = DistributedFactor(P, number, name='my_factor')
        sage: f.start()

        To check the result, do

        sage: print f.result 

        To check if it is done, do

        sage: print f.done

    Customization:
        To customize how the worker, server, or client behaves, you can look
        for their respective conf files in DOT_SAGE/dsage.  The configuration
        file should be self explanatory.
