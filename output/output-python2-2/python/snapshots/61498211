# Credits:
# Portions of this programs are (were) derived (through the old tested method of cut'n paste)
# from the obj import script obj_import.py: OBJ Import v0.9 by Campbell Barton (AKA Ideasman)
# (No more. I rewrote the lot. Nevertheless I wouldn't have been able to start this without Ideasman's
# script to read from!)
# Binary conversion functions are courtesy of SJH. Couldn't find the full name, and couldn't find any
# license info, I got the code for these from http://projects.blender.org/pipermail/bf-python/2004-July/001676.html
# The file reading strategy was 'inspired' by the NifToPoly script included with the 
# DAOC mapper, which used to be available at http://www.randomly.org/projects/mapper/ and was written and 
# is copyright 2002 of Oliver Jowett. His domain and e-mail address are however no longer reacheable.
# No part of the original code is included here, as I pretty much rewrote everything, hence this is the 
# only mention of the original copyright. An updated version of the script is included with the DAOC Mappergui
# application, available at http://nathrach.republicofnewhome.org/mappergui.html
#
# Thanks go to:
# Campbell Barton (AKA Ideasman, Cambo) for making code clear enough to be used as a learning resource.
#   Hey, this is my first ever python script!
# SJH for the binary conversion functions. Got the code off a forum somewhere, posted by Ideasman,
#   I suppose it's allright to use it
# Lars Rinde (AKA Taharez), for helping me a lot with the file format, and with some debugging even
#   though he doesn't 'do Python'
# Timothy Wakeham (AKA timmeh), for taking some of his time to help me get to terms with the way
#   the UV maps work in Blender
# Amorilia (don't know your name buddy), for bugfixes and testing.
