r"""
A collection of constructors of common graphs.

USE:

    To see a list of all graph constructors, type "graphs." and then press the
    tab key.  The documentation for each constructor includes information about
    each graph, which provides a useful reference.

PLOTTING:
    All graphs (i.e., networks) have an associated SAGE graphics object,
    which you can display:
        
        sage: G = graphs.WheelGraph(15)
        sage: P = G.plot()
        sage: P.show()

    If you create a graph in SAGE using the \code{Graph} command, then
    plot that graph, the positioning of nodes is determined using the
    spring-layout algorithm.  For the special graph constructors,
    which you get using \code{graphs.[tab]}, the positions are preset.
    For example, consider the Petersen graph with default node
    positioning vs. the Petersen graph constructed by this database:

        sage: petersen_spring = Graph({0:[1,4,5], 1:[0,2,6], 2:[1,3,7], 3:[2,4,8], 4:[0,3,9], 5:[0,7,8], 6:[1,8,9], 7:[2,5,9], 8:[3,5,6], 9:[4,6,7]})
        sage: petersen_spring.show()
        sage: petersen_database = graphs.PetersenGraph()
        sage: petersen_database.show()
    
    For all the constructors in this database (except the octahedral,
    dodecahedral, random and empty graphs), the position dictionary 
    is filled in, instead of using the spring-layout algorithm.
    
    For further visual examples and explanation, see the docstrings
    below, particularly for CycleGraph, StarGraph, WheelGraph, 
    CompleteGraph and CompleteBipartiteGraph.

    def BarbellGraph(self, n1, n2):
        """
        Returns a barbell graph with 2*n1 + n2 nodes.
        n1 must be greater than or equal to 2.
        
        A barbell graph is a basic structure that consists of a path graph of order 
        n2 connecting two complete graphs of order n1 each.
        
        This constructor depends on NetworkX numeric labels.  In this case, the
        (n1)th node connects to the path graph from one complete graph and the
        (n1+n2+1)th node connects to the path graph from the other complete graph.
        
        PLOTTING:
        Upon construction, the position dictionary is filled to override
        the spring-layout algorithm. By convention, each barbell graph will
        be displayed with the two complete graphs in the lower-left and
        upper-right corners, with the path graph connecting diagonally
        between the two.  Thus the (n1)th node will be drawn at a 45 degree
        angle from the horizontal right center of the first complete graph, 
        and the (n1+n2+1)th node will be drawn 45 degrees below the left
        horizontal center of the second complete graph.

    def CycleGraph(self, n):

        Returns a cycle graph with n nodes.
        
        A cycle graph is a basic structure which is also typically called
        an n-gon.
        
        This constructor is dependant on vertices numbered 0 through n-1
        in NetworkX \code{cycle_graph()}
        
        PLOTTING:
        Upon construction, the position dictionary is filled to override
        the spring-layout algorithm. By convention, each cycle graph will
        be displayed with the first (0) node at the top, with the rest
        following in a counterclockwise manner.
        
        The cycle graph is a good opportunity to compare efficiency of
        filling a position dictionary vs. using the spring-layout algorithm
        for plotting.  Because the cycle graph is very symmetric, the
        resulting plots should be similar (in cases of small n).
        
        Filling the position dictionary in advance adds O(n) to the
        constructor.  
        
        EXAMPLES:
        Compare plotting using the predefined layout and networkx:
            sage: import networkx            
            sage: n = networkx.cycle_graph(23)
            sage: spring23 = Graph(n)

            sage: spring23.show()
            sage: posdict23.show()
            
        We next view many cycle graphs as a SAGE graphics array.
        First we use the \code{CycleGraph} constructor, which fills in
        the position dictionary:
        
            sage: g = []
            sage: j = []
            sage: for i in range(9):

            ...        n.append(g[3*i + m].plot(vertex_size=50, vertex_labels=False))
            ...    j.append(n)

        the kite, with the highest degree.  But the fourth node only connects
        nodes that are otherwise connected, or those in its clique (i.e.: 
        Degree Centrality).  The eigth (7) node is where the kite meets the 
        tail.  It has degree = 3, less than the average, but is the only 
        connection between the kite and tail (i.e.: Betweenness Centrality).  
        The sixth and seventh nodes (5 and 6) are drawn in the third row and
        have degree = 5.  These nodes have the shortest path to all other nodes
        in the graph (i.e.: Closeness Centrality).  Please execute the

        manner.  (0) is the node connected to all other nodes.
        
        The star graph is a good opportunity to compare efficiency of
        filling a position dictionary vs. using the spring-layout algorithm
        for plotting.  As far as display, the spring-layout should push all
        other nodes away from the (0) node, and thus look very similar to
        this constructor's positioning.

        EXAMPLES:
            sage: import networkx

        Compare the plots:
            sage: n = networkx.star_graph(23)

            sage: posdict23 = graphs.StarGraph(23)

        A Wheel graph is a basic structure where one node is connected to

        This constructor depends on NetworkX numeric labels.

        Upon construction, the position dictionary is filled to override

        be displayed with the first (0) node in the center, the second node
        at the top, and the rest following in a counterclockwise manner.
        
        With the wheel graph, we see that it doesn't take a very large n
        at all for the spring-layout to give a counter-intuitive display.
        (See Graphics Array examples below).

        Returns a circulant graph with n nodes.
        
        A circulant graph has the property that the vertex i is
        connected with the vertices i+j and i-j for each j in adj.
        
        This constructor is dependant on vertices numbered 0 through n-1
        in NetworkX \code{cycle_graph()}
        
        PLOTTING:
        Upon construction, the position dictionary is filled to override
        the spring-layout algorithm. By convention, each circulant graph will
        be displayed with the first (0) node at the top, with the rest
        following in a counterclockwise manner.
        
        The circulant graph is a good opportunity to compare efficiency of
        filling a position dictionary vs. using the spring-layout algorithm
        for plotting.  Because the circulant graph is very symmetric, the
        resulting plots should be similar (in cases of small n).
        
        Filling the position dictionary in advance adds O(n) to the
        constructor.  
        
        EXAMPLES:
        Compare plotting using the predefined layout and networkx:
            sage: import networkx            
            sage: n = networkx.cycle_graph(23)
            sage: spring23 = Graph(n)

            sage: spring23.show()
            sage: posdict23.show()
            
        We next view many cycle graphs as a SAGE graphics array.
        First we use the \code{CirculantGraph} constructor, which fills in
        the position dictionary:

        Returns a complete graph on n nodes.
        
        A Complete Graph is a graph in which all nodes are connected to all
        other nodes.
        
        This constructor is dependant on vertices numbered 0 through n-1 in
        NetworkX complete_graph()
        
        PLOTTING:
        Upon construction, the position dictionary is filled to override
        the spring-layout algorithm. By convention, each complete graph
        will be displayed with the first (0) node at the top, with the
        rest following in a counterclockwise manner.
        
        In the complete graph, there is a big difference visually in using
        the spring-layout algorithm vs. the position dictionary used in
        this constructor.  The position dictionary flattens the graph,
        making it clear which nodes an edge is connected to.  But the
        complete graph offers a good example of how the spring-layout
        works.  The edges push outward (everything is connected), causing
        the graph to appear as a 3-dimensional pointy ball.  (See examples
        below).
        
        EXAMPLES:
        We view many Complete graphs with a SAGE Graphics Array, first
        with this constructor (i.e., the position dictionary filled):

    def CompleteBipartiteGraph(self, n1, n2):
        """
        Returns a Complete Bipartite Graph sized n1+n2, with each of the
        nodes [0,(n1-1)] connected to each of the nodes [n1,(n2-1)] and
        vice versa.
        
        A Complete Bipartite Graph is a graph with its vertices partitioned
        into two groups, V1 and V2.  Each v in V1 is connected to every v
        in V2, and vice versa.  
        
        PLOTTING:
        Upon construction, the position dictionary is filled to override
        the spring-layout algorithm. By convention, each complete bipartite
        graph will be displayed with the first n1 nodes on the top row (at
        y=1) from left to right.  The remaining n2 nodes appear at y=0,
        also from left to right.  The shorter row (partition with fewer
        nodes) is stretched to the same length as the longer row, unless
        the shorter row has 1 node; in which case it is centered.  The x
        values in the plot are in domain [0,max{n1,n2}].  
                
        In the Complete Bipartite graph, there is a visual difference in
        using the spring-layout algorithm vs. the position dictionary used
        in this constructor.  The position dictionary flattens the graph
        and separates the partitioned nodes, making it clear which nodes
        an edge is connected to.  The Complete Bipartite graph plotted with
        the spring-layout algorithm tends to center the nodes in n1 (see
        spring_med in examples below), thus overlapping its nodes and edges,
        making it typically hard to decipher.
        
        Filling the position dictionary in advance adds O(n) to the
        constructor.  Feel free to race the constructors below in the
        examples section.  The much larger difference is the time added by
        the spring-layout algorithm when plotting.  (Also shown in the
        example below).  The spring model is typically described as $O(n^3)$,
        as appears to be the case in the NetworkX source code.
        
        EXAMPLES:
        Two ways of constructing the complete bipartite graph, using different
        layout algorithms:

            sage: posdict_med = graphs.CompleteBipartiteGraph(11,17)

        Notice here how the spring-layout tends to center the nodes of n1

        algorithm, unless a position dictionary is specified.

        The average clustering has a hard time getting above a certain cutoff
        that depends on m. This cutoff is often quite low. Note that the
        transitivity (fraction of triangles to possible triangles) seems to go
        down with network size. It is essentially the Barabasi-Albert growth
        model with an extra step that each random edge is followed by a chance
        of making an edge to one of its neighbors too (and thus a triangle).
        This algorithm improves on B-A in the sense that it enables a higher
        average clustering to be attained if desired. It seems possible to
        have a disconnected graph with this algorithm since the initial m
