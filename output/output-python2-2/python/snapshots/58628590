# This is a script which delivers Change events from Darcs to the buildmaster
# each time a patch is pushed into a repository. Add it to the 'apply' hook
# on your canonical "central" repository, by putting something like the
# following in the _darcs/prefs/defaults file of that repository:
#
#  apply posthook /PATH/TO/darcs_buildbot.py BUILDMASTER:PORT
#  apply run-posthook
#
# (the second command is necessary to avoid the usual "do you really want to
# run this hook" prompt. Note that you cannot have multiple 'apply posthook'
# lines.)
#
# Note that both Buildbot and Darcs must be installed on the repository
# machine. You will also need the Python/XML distribution installed (the
# "python2.3-xml" package under debian).
