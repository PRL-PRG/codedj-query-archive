SAGE package management commands

A SAGE package has the extension .spkg.  It is a tarball that is
(usually) bzip2 compressed that contains arbitrary data and an
spkg-install file.  An SAGE package typically has the following
components:
\begin{itemize}
  \item spkg-install -- shell script that is run to install the package
  \item SAGE.txt -- file that describes how the package was made, who maintains it, etc.
  \item sage -- directory with extra patched version of files that needed during the install
\end{itemize}

Use the \code{install_package} command to install a new package, and use
\code{optional_packages} to list all optional packages available on the
central SAGE server.   The \code{upgrade} command upgrades all \emph{standard}
packages -- there is no auto-upgrade command for optional packages.

All package management can also be done via the SAGE command line.
