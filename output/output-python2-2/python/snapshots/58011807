"""Module for interactive demos using IPython.

This module implements a single class, Demo, for running Python scripts
interactively in IPython for demonstrations.  With very simple markup (a few
tags in comments), you can control points where the script stops executing and
returns control to IPython.

The file is run in its own empty namespace (though you can pass it a string of
arguments as if in a command line environment, and it will see those as
sys.argv).  But at each stop, the global IPython namespace is updated with the
current internal demo namespace, so you can work interactively with the data
accumulated so far.

By default, each block of code is printed (with syntax highlighting) before
executing it and you have to confirm execution.  This is intended to show the
code to an audience first so you can discuss it, and only proceed with
execution once you agree.  There are a few tags which allow you to modify this
behavior.

The supported tags are:

# <demo> --- stop ---

  Defines block boundaries, the points where IPython stops execution of the
  file and returns to the interactive prompt.

# <demo> silent

  Make a block execute silently (and hence automatically).  Typically used in
  cases where you have some boilerplate or initialization code which you need
  executed but do not want to be seen in the demo.
  
# <demo> auto

  Make a block execute automatically, but still being printed.  Useful for
  simple code which does not warrant discussion, since it avoids the extra
  manual confirmation.

# <demo> auto_all

  This tag can _only_ be in the first block, and if given it overrides the
  individual auto tags to make the whole demo fully automatic (no block asks
  for confirmation).  It can also be given at creation time (or the attribute
  set later) to override what's in the file.

While _any_ python file can be run as a Demo instance, if there are no stop
tags the whole file will run in a single block (no different that calling
first %pycat and then %run).  The minimal markup to make this useful is to
place a set of stop tags; the other tags are only there to let you fine-tune
the execution.

This is probably best explained with the simple example file below.  You can
copy this into a file named ex_demo.py, and try running it via:

from IPython.demo import Demo
d = Demo('ex_demo.py')
d()  <--- Call the d object (omit the parens if you have autocall on).

Each time you call the demo object, it runs the next block.  The demo object
has a few useful methods for navigation, like again(), jump(), seek() and
back().  It can be reset for a new run via reset() or reloaded from disk (in
case you've edited the source) via reload().  See their docstrings below.

#################### EXAMPLE DEMO <ex_demo.py> ###############################
'''A simple interactive demo to illustrate the use of IPython's Demo class.'''

print 'Hello, welcome to an interactive IPython demo.'

# The mark below defines a block boundary, which is a point where IPython will
# stop execution and return to the interactive prompt.
# Note that in actual interactive execution, 
# <demo> --- stop ---

x = 1
y = 2

# <demo> --- stop ---

# the mark below makes this block as silent
# <demo> silent

print 'This is a silent block, which gets executed but not printed.'

# <demo> --- stop ---
# <demo> auto
print 'This is an automatic block.'
print 'It is executed without asking for confirmation, but printed.'
z = x+y

print 'z=',x

# <demo> --- stop ---
# This is just another normal block.
print 'z is now:', z

print 'bye!'
