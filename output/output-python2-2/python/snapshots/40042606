"""
Fast HTML parser module written in C with the following features:
 1. Reentrant
    As soon as any HTML string data is available, we try to feed it
    to the HTML parser. This means that the parser has to scan possible
    incomplete data, recognizing as much as it can. Incomplete trailing
    data is saved for subsequent callsm, or it is just flushed into the
    output buffer with the flush() function.
    A reset() brings the parser back to its initial state, throwing away all
    buffered data.

 2. Coping with HTML syntax errors
    The parser recognizes as much as it can and passes the rest
    of the data as TEXT tokens.
    The scanner only passes complete recognized HTML syntax elements to
    the parser. Invalid syntax elements are passed as TEXT. This way we do
    not need the bison error recovery.
    Incomplete data is rescanned the next time the parser calls yylex() or
    when it is being flush()ed.
    
    The following syntax errors will be recognized correctly:
     1. missing quotes around attribute values
     2. "</...>" end tags in script modus
     3. missing ">" in tags
     4. invalid tag names
     5. invalid characters inside tags or tag attributes
    
    Additionally the parser has the following features:
     1. NULL bytes are changed into spaces
     2. <!-- ... --> inside a <script> or <style> are not treated as
        comments but as DATA

 3. Speed
    The FLEX code has options to generate a large but fast scanner.
    The parser ignores forbidden or unnecessary HTML end tags.
    The parser converts tag and attribute names to lower case for easier
    matching.
    The parser quotes all attribute values.
    Python memory management interface is used.

 4. Character encoding aware
    The parser itself is not encoding aware, but all the output are
    always Python Unicode strings.
