def wronskian(*args):
    """Returns the Wronskian of the provided functions, differentiating with
    respect to the given variable. If no variable is provided,
    diff(f) is called for each function f.

    wronskian(f1,...,fn, x) returns the Wronskian of f1,...,fn, with
    derivatives taken with respect to x.

    wronskian(f1,...,fn) returns the Wronskian of f1,...,fn where
    k'th derivatives are computed by doing `.derivative(k)' on each
    function.

    The Wronskian of a list of functions is a determinant of derivatives.
    The nth row (starting from 0) is a list of the nth derivatives of the
    given functions.

    For two functions:

                              | f   g  |
                 W(f, g) = det|        | = f*g' - g*f'.
                              | f'  g' |

    EXAMPLES:
        sage: wronskian(e^x, x^2)
        2*x*e^x - x^2*e^x

        sage: var('x, y'); wronskian(x*y, log(x), x)
        (x, y)
        y - log(x)*y

      If your functions are in a list, you can use `*' to turn them into
      arguments to wronskian():
        sage: wronskian(*[x^k for k in range(1, 5)])
        12*x^4

      If you want to use 'x' as one of the functions in the Wronskian,
      you can't put it last or it will be interpreted as the variable
      with respect to which we differentiate. There are several ways to
      get around this.

      Two-by-two Wronskian of sin(x) and e^x:
        sage: wronskian(sin(x), e^x, x)
        e^x*sin(x) - e^x*cos(x)

      Three-by-three Wronskian of sin(x), e^x, and x:
        sage: wronskian(sin(x), cos(x), x+0)
        x*(-sin(x)^2 - cos(x)^2)

      Or don't put x last:
        sage: wronskian(x, sin(x), e^x)
        x*(e^x*sin(x) + e^x*cos(x)) - 2*e^x*sin(x)

      Example where one of the functions is constant:
        sage: wronskian(1, e^(-x), e^(2*x))
        -6*e^x
