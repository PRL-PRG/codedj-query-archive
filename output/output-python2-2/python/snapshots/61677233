    Start the SAGE Notebook server. 

    INPUT:
        directory  -- (default: 'sage_notebook') directory that contains
                      the SAGE notebook files
        port       -- (default: 8000), port to serve the notebook on
        address    -- (default: 'localhost'), address to listen on
        port_tries -- (default: 0), number of additional ports to try if the
                      first one doesn't work (*not* implemented)
        secure     -- (default: True) if True use https so all
                      communication, e.g., logins and passwords,
                      between web browsers and the SAGE notebook is
                      encrypted (via GNU TLS).
        reset      -- (default: False) if True allows you to set the
                      admin password.  Use this if you forget your
                      admin password.
        accounts   -- (default: False) if True, any visitor to the website
                      will be able to create a new account.  If False,
                      only the admin can create accounts (currently, this
                      can only be done by running with accounts=True for
                      a few minutes, or on the command line with, e.g., 
                          nb = load('sage_notebook/nb.sobj')
                          nb.set_accounts(True)
                          nb.add_user("username", "password", "email@place", "user")

    EXAMPLES:
    
    1. I want to run the SAGE notebook server on a remote machine
       and be the only person allowed to log in.  Type

                   notebook(address="")

       the first time you do this you'll be prompted to set
       an administrator password.  Use this to login.

    2. I just want to run the server locally and do not want to be
       bothered with SSL, accounts, etc., and I am the only
       user so I do not have to worry about somebody else using
       the notebook on localhost and deleting my files.  Use
 
             notebook(secure = False)

    3. I want to create a SAGE notebook server that is open to anybody
       in the world to create new accounts, etc.  To run the SAGE
       notebook publically (1) at a minimu run it from a chroot jail
       (see the SAGE install guide), and (2) use a command like
    
    notebook(secure=True, server_pool=['sage1@localhost'], ulimit='-v 500000')

       The secure option enables enccryption between all users and the
       notebook server.  The server_pool option specifies that
       worksheet processes run as a separate user.  The ulimit option
       restricts the memory available to each worksheet processes to
       500MB.  You will have to explicitly login as the admin user
       and click "Server" in the upper right home page to configure the
       server to allow users to create new accounts.



    INPUT:  (more advanced)

      NOTE: The values of these two properties default to what they were
     last time the notebook command was called.
    
        server_pool -- (default: None), if given, should be a list like 
                      ['sage1@localhost', 'sage2@localhost'], where
                      you have setup ssh keys so that typing
                         ssh sage1@localhost
                      logs in without requiring a password, e.g., by typing
                      as the notebook server user
                          cd; ssh-keygen -t rsa
                      then put ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub as the file .ssh/authorized_keys2.
                      Note -- you have to get the permissions of files
                      and directories just right -- do a web search
                      for more details.
                      
        ulimit      -- (default: None -- leave as is), if given and server_pool is also given,
                      the worksheet processes are run with these constraints.
                      See the ulimit documentation. Common options include:
                           -f   The maximum size of files created by the shell
                           -t   The maximum amount of cpu time in seconds. 
                           -u   The maximum number of processes available to a single user. 
                           -v   The maximum amount of virtual memory available to the process.
                      Values are in 1024-byte increments, except for `-t', which is in seconds.
                      Example:  ulimit="-v 400000 -t 30"
