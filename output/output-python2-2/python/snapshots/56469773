"""
Support for package 'combine' in Rubber.

This package is used to gather several complete LaTeX documents into a single
one, possibly fine-tuning page numbering, generation of tables of contents,
and other features. Documents are included using the macro \\import, so
basically this support module makes it behave somewhat like \\include.
However, more subtle behaviour could be implemented, e.g. to reflect the the
way the package deals with \\documentclass and \\usepackage.
