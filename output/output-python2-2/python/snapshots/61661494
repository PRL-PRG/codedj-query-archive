class DistributedSage(object):
    r"""
    Distributed SAGE allows you to do distributed computing in SAGE.

    To get up and running quickly, run dsage.setup() to run the 
    configuration utility.

    Note that configuration files will be stored in the
    directory \code{\$DOT\_SAGE/dsage}.

    There are three distinct parts of Distributed SAGE:
        Server
            Launch the server with dsage.server()
            
        Worker
            Launch the worker with dsage.worker()
            
        Client
            Create the DSage object like this:
                d = DSage()
    
    EXAMPLES:
    This starts a server instance on localhost:
    
        sage: dsage.server()

    The dsage server is currently blocking by default.

    Open another sage instance and type:

        sage: dsage.worker() 

    This starts a worker connecting the localhost.

    Open yet another terminal and type:
        sage: D = DSage()

    This creates a connection to the remote server.  To do a simple
    evaluation, type:
        sage: job1 = D('2+2')

    This sends the job '2+2' to a worker and you can view the 
    result by typing:

        sage: print job1

    This is the most basic way of interacting with dsage. To do more
    complicated tasks, you should look at the DistributedFunction
    class.  For example, to do distributed integer factorization with
    ECM, type this:

        sage: f = DistributedFactor(P, number, name='my_factor')
        sage: f.start()

    To check the result, do

        sage: print f.result 

    To check if it is done, do

        sage: print f.done

    Customization:
    
        To customize how the worker, server, or client behaves, you
        can look for their respective conf files in DOT_SAGE/dsage.
        The configuration file should be self explanatory.
