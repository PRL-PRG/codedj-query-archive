r""" Computation of frobenius matrix on Monsky-Washnitzer cohomology.

The most interesting functions to be exported here are matrix_of_frobenius()
and adjusted_prec().

Currently this code is limited to the case p >= 5 (no GF(p^n) for n > 1), and
only handles the elliptic curve case (not more general hyperelliptic curves).

    -- David Harvey and Robert Bradshaw (initial code developed at the 2006
       MSRI graduate workshop, working with Jennifer Balakrishnan and Liang
       Xiao)
    -- David Harvey (Aug/Sep 2006): cleaned up, rewrote some chunks, lots
       more documentation, added Newton iteration method, added more complete
       "trace trick", integrated better into SAGE.

class SpecialCubicQuotientRing(CommutativeAlgebra):
  r""" Specialised class for representing the quotient ring
  $R[x,T]/(T - x^3 - ax - b)$, where $R$ is an arbitrary commutative base ring
  (in which 2 and 3 are invertible), $a$ and $b$ are elements of that ring.

  Polynomials are represented internally in the form $p_0 + p_1 x + p_2 x^2$
  where the $p_i$ are polynomials in $T$. Multiplication of polynomials
  always reduces high powers of $x$ (i.e. beyond $x^2$) to powers of $T$.

  Hopefully this ring is faster than a general quotient ring because it uses
  the special structure of this ring to speed multiplication (which is the
  dominant operation in the frobenius matrix calculation). I haven't actually
  tested this theory though...

  TODO:
    -- Eventually we will want to run this in characteristic 3, so we need to:
       (a) Allow Q(x) to contain an x^2 term, and
       (b) Remove the requirement that 3 be invertible. Currently this is used
           in the Toom-Cook algorithm to speed multiplication.

  EXAMPLES:
      sage: B, t = PolynomialRing(Integers(125)).objgen()
      sage: R = monsky_washnitzer.SpecialCubicQuotientRing(t^3 - t + B(1/4))
      sage: R
      SpecialCubicQuotientRing over Ring of integers modulo 125 with polynomial T = x^3 + 124*x + 94

    Get generators:
      sage: x, T = R.gens()
      sage: x
      (0) + (1)*x + (0)*x^2
      sage: T
      (T) + (0)*x + (0)*x^2

    Coercions:
      sage: R(7)
      (7) + (0)*x + (0)*x^2

    Create elements directly from polynomials:
      sage: A, z = R.poly_ring().objgen()
      sage: A
      Univariate Polynomial Ring in T over Ring of integers modulo 125
      sage: R.create_element(z^2, z+1, 3)
      (T^2) + (T + 1)*x + (3)*x^2

    Some arithmetic:
      sage: x^3
      (T + 31) + (1)*x + (0)*x^2
      sage: 3 * x**15 * T**2 + x - T
      (3*T^7 + 90*T^6 + 110*T^5 + 20*T^4 + 58*T^3 + 26*T^2 + 124*T) + (15*T^6 + 110*T^5 + 35*T^4 + 63*T^2 + 1)*x + (30*T^5 + 40*T^4 + 8*T^3 + 38*T^2)*x^2

    Retrieve coefficients (output is zero-padded):
      sage: x^10
      (3*T^2 + 61*T + 8) + (T^3 + 93*T^2 + 12*T + 40)*x + (3*T^2 + 61*T + 9)*x^2
      sage: (x^10).coeffs()
      [[8, 61, 3, 0], [40, 12, 93, 1], [9, 61, 3, 0]]

  asymptotically faster, when the precision gets large. However, in practice,
  this functions seems to be marginally faster for moderate precision, so I'm
  keeping it here until I figure out exactly why it's faster.)

  (This function does *not* yet use the cohomology relations
  -- that happens afterwards in the "reduction" step.)

  More specifically, it finds F0 and F1 in the quotient ring

  F0 and F1 are computed in the SpecialCubicQuotientRing associated
  to Q, so all powers of x^j for j >= 3 are reduced to powers of T.

  It uses the sum

  OUTPUT:
      2x2 matrix of frobenius on Monsky-Washnitzer cohomology, with entries

  EXAMPLES:
    A simple example:
      sage: p = 5
      sage: prec = 3
      sage: M = monsky_washnitzer.adjusted_prec(p, prec)
      sage: M
        5
      sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(Integers(p**M))
      sage: A = monsky_washnitzer.matrix_of_frobenius(x^3 - x + R(1/4), p, M)
      sage: A
       [3090  187]
       [2945  408]

    But the result is only accurate to prec digits:
      sage: B = A.change_ring(Integers(p**prec))
      sage: B
       [90 62]
       [70 33]

    Check trace (123 = -2 mod 125) and determinant:
      sage: B.det()
       5
      sage: B.trace()
       123
      sage: EllipticCurve([-1, 1/4]).ap(5)
       -2

    Try using the trace to speed up the calculation:
      sage: A = monsky_washnitzer.matrix_of_frobenius(x^3 - x + R(1/4),
      ...                                             p, M, -2)
      sage: A
       [2715  187]
       [1445  408]

    Hmmm... it looks different, but that's because the trace of our first
    answer was only -2 modulo 5^3, not -2 modulo 5^5. So the right answer is:
      sage: A.change_ring(Integers(p**prec))
       [90 62]
       [70 33]

    Check it works with only one digit of precision:
      sage: p = 5
      sage: prec = 1
      sage: M = monsky_washnitzer.adjusted_prec(p, prec)
      sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(Integers(p**M))
      sage: A = monsky_washnitzer.matrix_of_frobenius(x^3 - x + R(1/4), p, M)
      sage: A.change_ring(Integers(p))
       [0 2]
       [0 3]

    Here's an example that's particularly badly conditioned for using the
    trace trick:
      sage: p = 11
      sage: prec = 3
      sage: M = monsky_washnitzer.adjusted_prec(p, prec)
      sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(Integers(p**M))
      sage: A = monsky_washnitzer.matrix_of_frobenius(x^3 + 7*x + 8, p, M)
      sage: A.change_ring(Integers(p**prec))
       [1144  176]
       [ 847  185]

    The problem here is that the top-right entry is divisible by 11, and
    the bottom-left entry is divisible by 11^2. So when you apply the
    trace trick, neither F(dx/y) nor F(x dx/y) is enough to compute the
    whole matrix to the desired precision, even if you try increasing the
    target precision by one. Nevertheless, matrix_of_frobenius knows how to
    get the right answer by evaluating F((x+1) dx/y) instead:
      sage: A = monsky_washnitzer.matrix_of_frobenius(x^3 + 7*x + 8, p, M, -2)
      sage: A.change_ring(Integers(p**prec))
       [1144  176]
       [ 847  185]

    The running time is about O(p * prec^2) (times some logarithmic factors),
    so it's feasible to run on fairly large primes, or precision (or both?!?!):
      sage: p = 10007
      sage: prec = 2
      sage: M = monsky_washnitzer.adjusted_prec(p, prec)
      sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(Integers(p**M))
      sage: A = monsky_washnitzer.matrix_of_frobenius(            # long time
      ...                             x^3 - x + R(1/4), p, M)     # long time
      sage: B = A.change_ring(Integers(p**prec)); B               # long time
       [74311982 57996908]
       [95877067 25828133]
      sage: B.det()                                               # long time
       10007
      sage: B.trace()                                             # long time
       66
      sage: EllipticCurve([-1, 1/4]).ap(10007)                    # long time
       66

      sage: p = 5
      sage: prec = 300
      sage: M = monsky_washnitzer.adjusted_prec(p, prec)
      sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(Integers(p**M))
      sage: A = monsky_washnitzer.matrix_of_frobenius(            # long time
      ...                             x^3 - x + R(1/4), p, M)     # long time
      sage: B = A.change_ring(Integers(p**prec))                  # long time
      sage: B.det()                                               # long time
       5
      sage: -B.trace()                                            # long time
       2
      sage: EllipticCurve([-1, 1/4]).ap(5)                        # long time
       -2

    Let's check consistency of the results for a range of precisions:
      sage: p = 5
      sage: max_prec = 60
      sage: M = monsky_washnitzer.adjusted_prec(p, max_prec)
      sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(Integers(p**M))
      sage: A = monsky_washnitzer.matrix_of_frobenius(            # long time
      ...                         x^3 - x + R(1/4), p, M)         # long time
      sage: A = A.change_ring(Integers(p**max_prec))              # long time
      sage: result = []                                           # long time
      sage: for prec in range(1, max_prec):                       # long time
      ...       M = monsky_washnitzer.adjusted_prec(p, prec)      # long time
      ...       R, x = PolynomialRing(Integers(p**M)).objgen()    # long time
      ...       B = monsky_washnitzer.matrix_of_frobenius(        # long time
      ...                         x^3 - x + R(1/4), p, M)         # long time
      ...       B = B.change_ring(Integers(p**prec))              # long time
      ...       result.append(B == A.change_ring(                 # long time
      ...                                Integers(p**prec)))      # long time
      sage: result == [True] * (max_prec - 1)                     # long time
       True
      
        
    The remaining examples discuss what happens when you take the coefficient
    ring to be a power series ring; i.e. in effect you're looking at a family
    of curves.

    The code does in fact work...
      sage: p = 11
      sage: prec = 3
      sage: M = monsky_washnitzer.adjusted_prec(p, prec)
      sage: S.<t> = PowerSeriesRing(Integers(p**M), default_prec=4)
      sage: a = 7 + t + 3*t^2
      sage: b = 8 - 6*t + 17*t^2
      sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(S)
      sage: Q = x**3 + a*x + b
      sage: A = monsky_washnitzer.matrix_of_frobenius(Q, p, M)    # long time
      sage: B = A.change_ring(PowerSeriesRing(                    # long time
      ...         Integers(p**prec), 't', default_prec=4))        # long time
      sage: B                                                     # long time
       [1144 + 264*t + 841*t^2 + 1025*t^3 + O(t^4)  176 + 1052*t + 216*t^2 + 523*t^3 + O(t^4)]
       [   847 + 668*t + 81*t^2 + 424*t^3 + O(t^4)   185 + 341*t + 171*t^2 + 642*t^3 + O(t^4)]

    The trace trick should work for power series rings too, even in the badly-
    conditioned case. Unfortunately I don't know how to compute the trace in
    advance, so I'm not sure exactly how this would help. Also, I suspect
    the running time will be dominated by the expansion, so the trace trick
    won't really speed things up anyway. Another problem is that the
    determinant is not always p:
      sage: B.det()                                               # long time
       11 + 484*t^2 + 451*t^3 + O(t^4)

    However, it appears that the determinant always has the property that if
    you substitute t -> 11t, you do get the constant series p (mod p**prec).
    Similarly for the trace. And since the parameter only really makes sense
    when it's divisible by p anyway, perhaps this isn't a problem after all.
