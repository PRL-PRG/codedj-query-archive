# This script is a simple, generic model generator. A number of different
# models are created with varying number of clusters, depth of the supply path
# and number of demands per cluster. By evaluating the runtime of these models
# we can evaluate different aspects of Frepple's scalability.
#
# This test script is meant more as a sample for your own tests on evaluating
# scalability.
#
# The autogenerated supply network looks schematically as follows:
#   [ Operation -> buffer ] ...   [ -> Operation -> buffer ]  [ Delivery ]
#   [ Operation -> buffer ] ...   [ -> Operation -> buffer ]  [ Delivery ]
#   [ Operation -> buffer ] ...   [ -> Operation -> buffer ]  [ Delivery ]
#   [ Operation -> buffer ] ...   [ -> Operation -> buffer ]  [ Delivery ]
#   [ Operation -> buffer ] ...   [ -> Operation -> buffer ]  [ Delivery ]
#       ...                                  ...
# Each row represents a cluster.
# The operation+buffer are repeated as many times as the depth of the supply
# path parameter.
# In each cluster a single item is defined, and a parametrizable number of
# demands is placed on the cluster.
