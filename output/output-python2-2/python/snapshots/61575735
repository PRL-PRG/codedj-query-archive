Interface to REDUCE

!!!!NOT DONE!!!!

REDUCE \url{http://www.reduce-algebra.com/} is a commercial
interactive system for general algebraic computations of interest to
mathematicians, scientists and engineers.

[[Replace this by something relevant to your system.]]
    Type \code{gp.[tab]} for a list of all the functions available
    from your Gp install.  Type \code{gp.[tab]?} for Gp's
    help about a given function.  Type \code{gp(...)} to create
    a new Gp object, and \code{gp.eval(...)} to run a string
    using Gp (and get the result back as a string).


EXAMPLES:

[[Go through a standard tutorial for your software package
and do it via your SAGE interface.]]
