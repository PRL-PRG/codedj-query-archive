    It seems quite hard to implement manual line breaks with
    reportlab.platypus.  <br/>This is for later.  <br/>For now we just
    ignore them.

    Fortunately there is a workaround that should help in most cases:
    You can avoid automatic word wrapping by using
    <tt>verses()</tt>.
    
    The <tt>verses()</tt> method
    is similar to
    <tt>memo()</tt>,
    except that it creates 
    XPreformatted paragraph instances instead of the
    standard Paragraph.
