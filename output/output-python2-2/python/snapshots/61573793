Cremona's MWRANK Library

This is the SAGE interface to John Cremona's MWRANK C++ library for
arithmetic on elliptic curves.  The classes defined in this module
give SAGE interpreter-level to access much of the functionality of
MWRANK.  For most purposes it is not necessary to directly use these
classes; instead, one can create an \class{EllipticCurve} and call
methods that are implemented using this module.

\note{This interface is a direct library-level interface to mwrank.}

        If strictly less than 5 invariants are given, then the first
        ones are set to 0, so, e.g., \code{[3,4]} means $a_1=a_2=a_3=0$ and
