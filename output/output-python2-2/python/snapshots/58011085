"""Module for interactively running scripts.

This module implements classes for interactively running scripts written for
any system with a prompt which can be matched by a regexp suitable for
pexpect.  It can be used to run as if they had been typed up interactively, an
arbitrary series of commands for the target system.

The module includes classes ready for IPython (with the default prompts),
plain Python and SAGE, but making a new one is trivial.  To see how to use it,
simply run the module as a script:

./irunner.py --help


This is an extension of Ken Schutte <kschutte-AT-csail.mit.edu>'s script
contributed on the ipython-user list:

http://scipy.net/pipermail/ipython-user/2006-May/001705.html


NOTES:

 - This module requires pexpect, available in most linux distros, or which can
 be downloaded from

    http://pexpect.sourceforge.net

 - Because pexpect only works under Unix or Windows-Cygwin, this has the same
 limitations.  This means that it will NOT work under native windows Python.

          format used by pexpect.  This basically means that it can be either
          a string (to be compiled as a regular expression) or a list of such
          (it must be a true list, as pexpect does type checks).

          ommitted when the first prompt is matched, but are NOT ommitted when
          the continuation one matches, since this is how python signals the
          end of multiline input interactively.

This is an interface to the various interactive runners available in this
module.  If you want to pass specific options to one of the runners, you need
to first terminate the main options with a '--', and then provide the runner's
options.  For example:

irunner.py --python -- --help

will pass --help to the python runner.  Similarly,

irunner.py --ipython -- --log test.log script.ipy

will run the script.ipy file under the IPython runner, logging all output into
the test.log file.
