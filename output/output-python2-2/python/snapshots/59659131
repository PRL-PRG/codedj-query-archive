class IncludeSourceMacro(WikiMacroBase):
    """Includes a source file from the repository into the Wiki. 

    There is one required parameter, which is the path to the 
    file to include. This should be the repository path, not a 
    full URL. 

    Optional named parameters are:
     * ''start '' The first line of the file to include. Defaults to the 
     beginning of the file. Otherwise should be a numeric value. 

     Note that files start with line 1, not line 0. 
     * ''end'' The last line of the file to include. Defaults to the end
     of the file. 

     Note that both 'start' and 'end' are used for array slicing the 
     lines of the file, so if (for example) you want the last 20 lines 
     of the file, you can use start=-20 and leave end blank. 
     * ''rev'' Which revision to include. This defaults to HEAD if 
     not supplied. Otherwise this should be a valid numeric revision 
     number in your version control repository. 
     * ''mimetype'' Which mimetype to use to determine syntax highlighting. 
     If not supplied, this is determined by the file extension (which
     is normally what you want)

    Examples:
    {{{
        # include entire file
        [[IncludeSource(trunk/proj/file.py)]]

        # includes line 20-50 inclusive
        [[IncludeSource(trunk/proj/file.py, start=20, end=50)]]

        # includes last 30 lines of file at revision 1200
        [[IncludeSource(trunk/proj/file.py, start=-30, rev=1200)]]

        # include entire file but formatted plain
        [[IncludeSource(trunk/proj/file.py, mimetype=text/plain)]]

    }}}

    See TracLinks, TracSyntaxColoring and trac/mimeview/api.py

    TODO
    {{{
    * Fix non-localized strings

    * Fix proper encoding of output

    * Implement some sort of caching (especially in cases where the 
    revision is known and we know that the contents won't change). 

    * Allow multiple chunks from the file in one call. You can do this
    with the existing code, but it will pull the entire file out of
    version control and trim it for each chunk, so this could be 
    optimized a bit.  This could be done with the Ranges object
