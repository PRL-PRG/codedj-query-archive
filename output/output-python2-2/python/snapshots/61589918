\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Scheme:}
  A scheme whose datatype might be not be defined in terms 
  of algebraic equations: e.g. the Jacobian of a curve may be 
  represented by means of a Scheme.
  
\item {\bf AlgebraicScheme:}
  A scheme defined by means of polynomial equations, which may be 
  reducible or defined over a ring other than a field. 
  In particular, the defining ideal need not be a radical ideal, 
  and an algebraic scheme may be defined over Spec(R).
\end{itemize}  

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf AmbientSpaces:} Most effective models of algebraic scheme will be 
  defined, not by generic gluings, but by embeddings in some fixed 
  ambient space.

\item {\bf AffineSpace:}
  Affine spaces, and their affine subschemes form the most important 
  universal objects from which algebraic schemes are built.  
  The affine spaces form universal objects in the sense that a morphism 
  is uniquely determined by the images of its coordinate functions and 
  any such images determine a well-defined morphism.

  By default affine spaces will embed in some ordinary projective space, 
  unless it is created as an affine patch of another object.
  
\item {\bf ProjectiveSpace:}

  The projective spaces are the most natural ambient spaces for most 
  projective objects.  They are locally universal objects.
  
\item {\bf ProjectiveSpace\_ordinary (not implemented)}
  The ordinary projective spaces have the standard weights $[1,..,1]$
  on their coefficients.
  
\item {\bf ProjectiveSpace\_weighted (not implemented):}
  A special subtype for non-standard weights.
  
\item {\bf ToricSpace (not implemented):}
  This defines a projective toric variety, which defines a space
  equipped with a toral action and certain defining data.  These
  generalise projective spaces, but it is not envisioned that the 
  latter should inherit from the \code{ToricSpace} type.

\item {\bf AlgebraicScheme\_subscheme\_affine:}
  An algebraic scheme defined by means of an embedding in a 
  fixed ambient affine space.

\item {\bf AlgebraicScheme\_subscheme\_projective:}
  An algebraic scheme defined by means of an embedding in a fixed ambient 
  projective space.
  
\item {\bf QuasiAffineScheme (not yet implemented):}
  An open subset $U = X \setminus Z$ of a closed subset $X$ of affine space; note 
  that this is mathematically a quasi-projective scheme, but its 
  ambient space is an affine space and its points are represented by 
  affine rather than projective points.

  NOTE: AlgebraicScheme\_quasi is implemented, as a base class
  for this.
  
\item {\bf QuasiProjectiveScheme (not yet implemented):}
  An open subset of a closed subset of projective space; this datatype
  stores the defining polynomial, polynomials, or ideal defining the 
  projective closure $X$ plus the closed subscheme $Z$ of $X$ whose complement 
  $U = X \setminus Z$ is the quasi-projective scheme.

  Note: the quasi-affine and quasi-projective datatype lets one create
  schemes like the multiplicative group scheme $\GG_m = \AA^1\setminus
  \{(0)\}$ and the non-affine scheme $\AA^2\setminus \{(0,0)\}$.  The
  latter is not affine and is not of the form $\Spec(R)$.
  \end{itemize}


\subsection{TODO List}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf PointSets and points over a ring:}
  For algebraic schemes $X/S$ and $T/S$ over $S$, one can form 
  the point set $X(T)$ of morphisms from $T\to X$ over $S$.

        sage: PP.<X,Y,Z> = ProjectiveSpace(2, QQ)
        sage: PP
        Projective Space of dimension 2 over Rational Field

  The last line is an abuse of language -- returning the generators 
  of the coordinate ring by \code{gens()}.

  A projective space object in the category of schemes is a locally 
  free object -- the images of the generator functions \emph{locally}
  determine a point.  Over a field, one can choose one of the standard 
  affine patches by the condition that a coordinate function $X_i \ne 0$

        sage: PP(QQ)
        Set of Rational Points of Projective Space of dimension 2 over Rational Field
        sage: PP(QQ)([-2,3,5])
        (-2/5 : 3/5 : 1)

  Over a ring, this is not true, e.g. even over an integral domain which is not 
  a PID, there may be no \emph{single} affine patch which covers a point.

        sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
        sage: S.<t> = R.quo(x^2+5)
        sage: P.<X,Y,Z> = ProjectiveSpace(2, S)
        sage: P(S)
        Set of Rational Points of Projective Space of dimension 2 over
        Univariate Quotient Polynomial Ring in t over Integer Ring with
        modulus x^2 + 5 

  In order to represent the projective point $(2:1+t) = (1-t:3)$ we 
  note that the first representative is not well-defined at the 
  prime $pp = (2,1+t)$ and the second element is not well-defined at 
  the prime $qq = (1-t,3)$, but that $pp + qq = (1)$, so globally the
  pair of coordinate representatives is well-defined.

        sage: P( [2, 1+t] )
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        NotImplementedError
  
  In fact, we need a test \code{R.ideal([2,1+t]) == R.ideal([1])} in order 
  to make this meaningful.
\end{itemize}
