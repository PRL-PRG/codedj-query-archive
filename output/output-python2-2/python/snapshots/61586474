Interface to PHC.

PHC computes numerical information about systems of polynomials over
the complex numbers.

PHC implements polynomial homotopy methods to exploit structure in
order to better approximate all isolated solutions. The package also
includes extra tools to handle positive dimensional solution
components.

        INPUT:
            polys -- a list of polynomials in a SAGE polynomial ring
                     over a field that embeds into the complex
                     numbers.

                describes these polynomials.
            -- a mapping between variable names.

        PHC has the following constraint on polynomials:
            An unknown can be denoted by at most 3 characters.  The
            first character must be a letter and the other two
            characters must be different from '+', '-', '*', '^', '/',
            ';', '(' and ')'.  The letter i means sqrt(-1), whence it
            does not represent an unknown.  The number of unknowns may
            not exceed the declared dimension.

        Thus just like for the Gfan interface, it is necessary to map
        the SAGE variables (which can be arbitrarily long) to
        variables that satisfy the above constraints.

        worked fine -- they must have improved their program.
