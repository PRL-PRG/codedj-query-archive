r"""
Interface to PHC.

PHC computes numerical information about systems of polynomials over
the complex numbers.

PHC implements polynomial homotopy methods to exploit structure in
order to better approximate all isolated solutions. The package also
includes extra tools to handle positive dimensional solution
components.

AUTHOR:
   -- PHC was written by J. Verschelde, R. Cools, and many others (?)
   -- William Stein and Kelly ?? -- first version of interface to PHC
   -- Marshall Hampton -- second version of interface to PHC

TODO:
    This either needs to be able to handle arbitrary PHCpack command
    options, or have enough special purpose functions added to get the
    full functionality.  One important missing special case is having
    a root-counting function that could do mixed volumes and
    structured Bezout counts.  Another nice feature to have would be a
    graphical output of the path-tracking, as has been done for Maple.

        PHC has the following constraint on polynomials:
            An unknown can be denoted by at most 3 characters.  The
            first character must be a letter and the other two
            characters must be different from '+', '-', '*', '^', '/',
            ';', '(' and ')'.  The letter i means sqrt(-1), whence it
            does not represent an unknown.  The number of unknowns may
            not exceed the declared dimension.

        Thus just like for the Gfan interface, it is necessary to map
        the SAGE variables (which can be arbitrarily long) to
        variables that satisfy the above constraints.
