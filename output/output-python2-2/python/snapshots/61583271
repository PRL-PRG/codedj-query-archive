## Yes, you did exactly the right thing, which I verified as follows:

## (1) delete SAGE_ROOT/data/conway_polynomials/*
## (2) put your conway_polynomial.py.bz2 file in a new directory
##      /home/was/s/data/src/conway/
## (3) Start SAGE:
## sage: c = ConwayPolynomials(read_only=False)
## sage: c._init()       # builds database
## sage: c.polynomial(3,10)
## [2, 1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1]
## (4) restart and test:
## sage: conway_polynomial(3,10)
## x^10 + 2*x^6 + 2*x^5 + 2*x^4 + x + 2
