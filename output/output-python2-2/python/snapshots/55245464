Methods for working with kickstart versions.

This module defines several symbolic constants that specify kickstart syntax
versions.  Each version corresponds roughly to one release of Red Hat Linux,
Red Hat Enterprise Linux, or Fedora Core as these are where most syntax
changes take place.

This module also exports several functions:

    makeVersion - Given a version number, return an instance of the
                  matching handler class.

    returnClassForVersion - Given a version number, return the matching
                            handler class.  This does not return an
                            instance of that class, however.

    stringToVersion - Convert a string representation of a version number
                      into the symbolic constant.

    versionToString - Perform the reverse mapping.
