"""Word completion for IPython.

This module is a fork of the rlcompleter module in the Python standard
library.  The original enhancements made to rlcompleter have been sent
upstream and were accepted as of Python 2.3, but we need a lot more
functionality specific to IPython, so this module will continue to live as an
IPython-specific utility.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Original rlcompleter documentation:

This requires the latest extension to the readline module (the
completes keywords, built-ins and globals in __main__; when completing
NAME.NAME..., it evaluates (!) the expression up to the last dot and
completes its attributes.

It's very cool to do "import string" type "string.", hit the
completion key (twice), and see the list of names defined by the
string module!

Tip: to use the tab key as the completion key, call

    readline.parse_and_bind("tab: complete")

Notes:

- Exceptions raised by the completer function are *ignored* (and
generally cause the completion to fail).  This is a feature -- since
readline sets the tty device in raw (or cbreak) mode, printing a
traceback wouldn't work well without some complicated hoopla to save,
reset and restore the tty state.

- The evaluation of the NAME.NAME... form may cause arbitrary
application defined code to be executed if an object with a
__getattr__ hook is found.  Since it is the responsibility of the
application (or the user) to enable this feature, I consider this an
acceptable risk.  More complicated expressions (e.g. function calls or
indexing operations) are *not* evaluated.

- GNU readline is also used by the built-in functions input() and
raw_input(), and thus these also benefit/suffer from the completer
features.  Clearly an interactive application can benefit by
specifying its own completer function and using raw_input() for all
its input.

- When the original stdin is not a tty device, GNU readline is never
used, and this module (and the readline module) are silently inactive.
