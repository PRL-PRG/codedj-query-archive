    """Email wrapping formatter

    This macro takes an email message and will wrap lines to 
    72 characters (default), or a length specified.  It will
    also put the emails inside a preformatted block.

    Invocation:
    {{{
    #!email
    <email stuff here>
    }}}
    To wrap to a specified length, the line imediately following
    the invocation should contain `cols: ` followed by the number
    of columns at wich we wrap.  For example:
    {{{
    #!email
    cols: 40
    <email stuff here>
    }}}
    It is important that the `cols:` starts at the beginning of
    the line and that only a number follows it.
