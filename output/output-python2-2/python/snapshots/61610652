Watkins Symmetric Power $L$-function Calculator

SYMPOW is a package to compute special values of symmetric power
elliptic curve L-functions. It can compute up to about 64 digits of
precision.  This interface provides complete access to sympow, which
is a standard part of \sage (and includes the extra data files).

\note{Each call to \code{sympow} runs a complete \code{sympow}
process.}

AUTHOR:
    -- Mark Watkins  (2005-2006): wrote and released sympow
    -- William Stein (2006-03-05): wrote SAGE interface

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT (from sympow readme):
\begin{itemize}
\item The quad-double package was modified from David Bailey's package:
\url{http://crd.lbl.gov/~dhbailey/mpdist/}

\item The \code{squfof} implementation was modified from Allan Steel's
version of Arjen Lenstra's original LIP-based code.

\item The \code{ec_ap} code was originally written for the kernel of
MAGMA, but was modified to use small integers when possible.

\item SYMPOW was originally developed using PARI, but due to licensing
difficulties, this was eliminated. SYMPOW also does not use the
standard math libraries unless Configure is run with the -lm option.
SYMPOW still uses GP to compute the meshes of inverse Mellin
transforms (this is done when a new symmetric power is added to
datafiles).

========================================================================

Adding new symmetric powers:

SYMPOW keeps data for symmetric powers in the directory datafiles
If a pre-computed mesh of inverse Mellin transform values is not
available for a given symmetric power, SYMPOW will fail. The command

     sympow('-new_data 2')

will add the data the 2nd symmetric power, while

     sympow('-new_data 3d2')

will add the data for the 2nd derivative and 3rd symmetric power,

     sympow('-new_data 6d0h')

will add the data for the 0th derivative of the 6th Hecke power, and

     sympow('-new_data 4c')

will add data for the 4th symmetric power for curves with CM
(these need to be done separately for powers divisible by 4).

The mesh files are stored in binary form, and thus endian-ness is a
worry when moving from one platform to another.

To enable modular degree computations, the 2nd symmetric power must
be extant, and analytic rank requires derivatives of the 1st power.
