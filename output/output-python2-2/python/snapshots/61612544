Sequences

A mutable sequence of elements with a common guaranteed category,
which can be set immutable.

Sequence derives from list, so have all the functionality of lists and
can be used wherever lists are used.  When a sequence is created
without explicitly given the common universe of the elements, the
constructor coerces the first and second element to come
\emph{canonical} common parent, if possible, then the second and
third, etc..  If this is possible, it then coerces everything into the
canonical parent at the end.  (Note that canonical coercion is very
restrictive.)  The sequence then has a function \code{universe()}
which returns either the common canonical parent (if the coercion
succeeded), or the category of all objects (Objects()).  So if you
have a list $v$ and type

    sage: v = [1, 2/3, 5]
    sage: w = Sequence(v)
    sage: w.universe()
    Rational Field
       
then since \code{w.universe()} is $\Q$ then you're guaranteed that all
elements of $w$ are rationals:

    sage: v[0].parent()
    Integer Ring
    sage: w[0].parent()
    Rational Field

If you do assignment to $w$ this property of being rationals is guaranteed
to be preserved.

    sage: w[0] = 2
    sage: w[0].parent()
    Rational Field
    sage: w[0] = 'hi'
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: unable to convert hi to a rational

However, if you do \code{w = Sequence(v)} and the resulting universe
is \code{Objects()}, the elements are not guaranteed to have any
special parent.  This is what should happen, e.g., with finite field
elements of different characteristics:

    sage: v = Sequence([GF(3)(1), GF(7)(1)])
    sage: v.universe()
    Category of objects

You can make a list immutable with \code{v.freeze()}.  Assignment is
never again allowed on an immutable list.

Creation of a sequence involves making a copy of the input list, and
substantial coercions.  It can be greatly sped up by explicitly
specifying the universe of the sequence:

    sage: v = Sequence(range(10000), universe=ZZ)

class Sequence(sage.ext.sage_object.SageObject, list):
    """
    A mutable list of elements with a common guaranteed universe,
    which can be set immutable.

    A universe is either an object that supports coercion (e.g., a parent),
    or a category.

    INPUT:
        x -- a list or tuple instance
        universe -- (default: None) the universe of elements; if None determined
                    using canonical coercions and the entire list of elements.
                    If list is empty, is category Objects() of all objects.
        check -- (default: True) whether to coerce the elements of x into the universe
        cr -- (default: False) if True, then print a carriage return after each comma
                               when printing this sequence.

    OUTPUT:
        a sequence

    EXAMPLES:
        sage: v = Sequence(range(10))
        sage: v.universe()
        <type 'int'>
        sage: v
        [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

    You can also use seq for "Sequence", which is identical to using Sequence:
        sage: v = seq([1,2,1/1]); v
        [1, 2, 1]
        sage: v.universe()
        Rational Field
        sage: v.parent()
        Category of sequences in Rational Field
        sage: v.parent()([3,4/3])
        [3, 4/3]
        

    Note that assignment coerces if possible, 
        sage: v = Sequence(range(10), ZZ)
        sage: a = QQ(5)
        sage: v[3] = a
        sage: parent(v[3])
        Integer Ring
        sage: parent(a)
        Rational Field
        sage: v[3] = 2/3
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        TypeError: Unable to coerce rational (=2/3) to an Integer.

    Sequences can be used absolutely anywhere lists or tuples can be used:
        sage: isinstance(v, list)
        True

    Sequences are hashable (unlike Python lists), though the hashing
    is potentially slow, since it first involves conversion of the
    sequence to a tuple, and returning the hash of that.  The hash
    is cached, and is only recomputed if the sequence is changed
    (which has a small performance penalty for assignment).

        sage: hash(v)
        2083920238            # 32-bit
        -8049699692026128018  # 64-bit
        sage: v[0] = 10
        sage: hash(v)
        -377547984            # 32-bit
        -2271601447248391376  # 64-bit

    If you really know what you are doing, you can circumvent the type
    checking (for an efficiency gain):
        sage: list.__setitem__(v, int(1), 2/3)        # bad circumvention
        sage: v
        [10, 2/3, 2, 5, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
        sage: list.__setitem__(v, int(1), int(2))     # not so bad circumvention

    You can make a sequence with a new universe from an old sequence.
        sage: w = Sequence(v, QQ)
        sage: w
        [10, 2, 2, 5, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
        sage: w.universe()
        Rational Field
        sage: w[1] = 2/3
        sage: w
        [10, 2/3, 2, 5, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

    Sequences themselves live in a category, the category of all sequences
    in the given universe. 
        sage: w.category()
        Category of sequences in Rational Field
        
    This is also the parent of any sequence:
        sage: w.parent()
        Category of sequences in Rational Field

    The default universe for any sequence, if no compatible parent structure
    can be found, is the universe of all SAGE objects.

    This example illustrates how every element of a list is taken into account
    when constructing a sequence.
        sage: v = Sequence([1,7,6,GF(5)(3)]); v
        [1, 2, 1, 3]
        sage: v.universe()
        Finite Field of size 5
        sage: v.parent()
        Category of sequences in Finite Field of size 5
        sage: v.parent()([7,8,9])
        [2, 3, 4]
