# There are two kinds of comments: those which have some white space
# immediately following the # - the translator comments -, which comments are
# created and maintained exclusively by the translator, and those which have
# some non-white character just after the # - the automatic comments -, which
# comments are created and maintained automatically by GNU gettext
# tools. Comment lines starting with #. contain comments given by the
# programmer, directed at the translator; these comments are called extracted
# comments because the xgettext program extracts them from the program's source
# code. Comment lines starting with #: contain references to the program's
# source code. Comment lines starting with #, contain flags; more about these
# below. Comment lines starting with #| contain the previous untranslated
# string for which the translator gave a translation.
