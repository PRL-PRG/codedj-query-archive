Lattice and reflexive polytopes

This module provides tools for work with lattice and reflexive
polytopes. A \emph{convex polytope} is the convex hull of finitely
many points in $\RR^n$.  The dimension $n$ of a polytope is the
smallest $n$ such that the polytope can be embedded in $\RR^n$.

A \emph{lattice polytope} is a polytope whose vertices all have
integer coordinates.

If $L$ is a lattice polytope, the dual polytope of $L$ is
$$
  \{y \in \Z^n :   x\cdot y \geq -1 \text{ all } x \in L\}
$$
A \emph{reflexive polytope} is a lattice polytope, such that its polar
is also a lattice polytope, i.e. has vertices with integer coordinates.

This SAGE module uses Package for Analyzing Lattice Polytopes (PALP),
which is a program written in C by Maximilian Kreuzer and Harald
Skarke, which is freely available under the GNU licence terms at
\url{http://tph16.tuwien.ac.at/~kreuzer/CY/}.  Moreover, PALP is
included standard with SAGE.

PALP is described in the paper math.SC/0204356. Its distribution also
contains the application nef.x, which was created by Erwin Riegler and
computes nef partitions and Hodge data for toric complete
intersections.

ACKNOWLEDGMENT: polytope.py module written by William Stein was used
as an example of organizing an interface between an external program
and SAGE.  William Stein also helped Andrey Novoseltsev with debugging
and tuning of this module.

IMPORTANT NOTE: PALP requires some parameters to be determined during
compilation time, i.e., the maximum dimension of polytopes, the
maximum number of points, etc.  These limitations may lead to errors
during calls to different functions of these module. Currently, a
ValueError exception will be raised if the output of poly.x or nef.x
is empty or contains the exclamation mark. The error message will
contain the exact command that caused an error, the description and
vertices of the polytope, and the obtained output.

Data obtained from PALP and some other data is cached and most
returned values are immutable. In particular, you cannot change the
vertices of the polytope or their order after creation of the
polytope.

If you are going to  work with large sets of data, take a look at all_*
functions in this module. They precompute different data for sequences
of polynomials with a few runs of external programs. This can significantly
affect the time of future computations. You can also use dump/load, but not
all data will be stored (currently only faces and the number of their internal
and boundary points are stored, in addition to polytope vertices and its polar).

    Construct a lattice polytope.

    LatticePolytope(data, [desc], [compute_vertices], [copy_vertices], [n])

    INPUT:
        data -- a matrix of \emph{MAXIMAL} rank, whose columns are vertices of
                the polytope (unless \code{compute_vertices} is True);
                a file with matrix data, open for reading;
                or a filename of such a file.
                See \code{read_palp_matrix} for the file format.
                Points of the given matrix must span the space.
        desc -- (default: "A lattice polytope") description of the polytope.
        compute_vertices -- (default: False) if True, the convex hull of
                the given points will be computed for determining vertices.
                Otherwise, the given points are vertices.
        copy_vertices -- (default: True) if False and \code{data} is a
                matrix of vertices, it will be made immutable.
        n -- (default: 0) if \code{data} is a name of a file, that contains
                data blocks for several polytopes, the n-th block will be used.
                \emph{NUMERATION STARTS WITH ZERO}.

    OUTPUT:
        a lattice polytope

    EXAMPLES:
    Here we construct a polytope from a matrix whose columns are
    vertices in 3-dimensional space. In the first case a copy of the
    given matrix is made during construction, in the second one the
    matrix is made immutable and used as a matrix of vertices.

        sage: m = matrix(ZZ, [[1, 0, 0, -1,  0,  0],
        ...                   [0, 1, 0,  0, -1,  0],
        ...                   [0, 0, 1,  0,  0, -1]])
        ...
        sage: p = LatticePolytope(m)
        sage: p
        A lattice polytope: 3-dimensional, 6 vertices.
        sage: m.is_mutable()
        True
        sage: m is p.vertices()
        False
        sage: p = LatticePolytope(m, copy_vertices=False)
        sage: m.is_mutable()
        False
        sage: m is p.vertices()
        True

    We draw a pretty picture of the polytype in 3-dimensional space:
        sage: p.plot().show() 

    Now we add an extra point to the matrix...
        sage: m = matrix(ZZ, [[1, 0, 0, -1,  0,  0, 0],
        ...                   [0, 1, 0,  0, -1,  0, 0],
        ...                   [0, 0, 1,  0,  0, -1, 0]])
        ...
        sage: p = LatticePolytope(m, "A lattice polytope with WRONG vertices")
        sage: p
        A lattice polytope with WRONG vertices: 3-dimensional, 7 vertices.

    The above construction is WRONG since the origin is an interior point of the
    octahedron. If you don't know in advance that your data are vertices of the
    polytope, use \code{compute_vertices} option as below:
        sage: p = LatticePolytope(m, "A lattice polytope constructed from 7 points",
        ...                         compute_vertices=True)
        ...
        sage: p
        A lattice polytope constructed from 7 points: 3-dimensional, 6 vertices.

    Points of the given matrix must always span the space, this conditions will
    be checked only if you specify \code{compute_vertices} option:
        sage: m = matrix(ZZ, [[1, 0, -1,  0],
        ...                   [0, 1,  0, -1],
        ...                   [0, 0,  0,  0]])
        ...
        sage: p = LatticePolytope(m, compute_vertices=True)
