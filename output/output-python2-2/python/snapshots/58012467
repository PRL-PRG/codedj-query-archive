"""Word completion for GNU readline 2.0.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: This version is a re-implementation of rlcompleter with selectable
namespace.

The problem with rlcompleter is that it's hardwired to work with
__main__.__dict__, and in some cases one may have 'sandboxed' namespaces. So
this class is a ripoff of rlcompleter, with the namespace to work in as an
optional parameter.

This class can be used just like rlcompleter, but the Completer class now has
a constructor with the optional 'namespace' parameter.

A patch has been submitted to Python@sourceforge for these changes to go in
the standard Python distribution.

The patch went in for Python 2.3.  Once IPython drops support for Python 2.2,
this file can be significantly reduced.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Original rlcompleter documentation:

This requires the latest extension to the readline module (the
completes keywords, built-ins and globals in __main__; when completing
NAME.NAME..., it evaluates (!) the expression up to the last dot and
completes its attributes.

It's very cool to do "import string" type "string.", hit the
completion key (twice), and see the list of names defined by the
string module!

Tip: to use the tab key as the completion key, call

    readline.parse_and_bind("tab: complete")

Notes:

- Exceptions raised by the completer function are *ignored* (and
generally cause the completion to fail).  This is a feature -- since
readline sets the tty device in raw (or cbreak) mode, printing a
traceback wouldn't work well without some complicated hoopla to save,
reset and restore the tty state.

- The evaluation of the NAME.NAME... form may cause arbitrary
application defined code to be executed if an object with a
__getattr__ hook is found.  Since it is the responsibility of the
application (or the user) to enable this feature, I consider this an
acceptable risk.  More complicated expressions (e.g. function calls or
indexing operations) are *not* evaluated.

- GNU readline is also used by the built-in functions input() and
raw_input(), and thus these also benefit/suffer from the completer
features.  Clearly an interactive application can benefit by
specifying its own completer function and using raw_input() for all
its input.

- When the original stdin is not a tty device, GNU readline is never
used, and this module (and the readline module) are silently inactive.
