def all_graph_colorings(G,n,count_only=False):
    """
    Computes all n-colorings of the graph G by casting the graph
    coloring problem into an exact cover problem, and passing this
    into an implementation of the Dancing Links algorithm described
    by Knuth (who attributes the idea to Hitotumatu and Noshita).

    The construction works as follows:
     (columns)
      * The first |V| columns correspond to a vertex -- a 1 in this
           column indicates that that vertex has a color.
      * After those |V| columns, we add n*|E| columns -- a 1 in
           these columns indicate that a particular edge is
           incident to a vertex with a certain color.

     (rows)
      * For each vertex, add n rows; one for each color c.  Place
           a 1 in the column corresponding to the vertex, and a 1
           in the appropriate column foreach edge incident to the 
           vertex, indicating that that edge is incident to the 
           color c.
      * If n > 2, the above construction cannot be exactly covered
           since each edge will be incident to only two vertices
           (and hence two colors) - so we add n*|E| rows, each one
           containing a 1 for each of the n*|E| columns.  These
           get added to the cover solutions "for free" during the
           backtracking.

    Note that this construction results in n*|V| + 2*n*|E| + n*|E|
    entries in the matrix.  The Dancing Links algorithm uses a
    sparse representation, so if the graph is simple, |E| <= |V|^2
    and n <= |V|, this construction runs in O(|V|^3) time.
    Back-conversion to a coloring solution is a simple scan of the
    solutions, which will contain |V| + (n-2)*|E| entries,  so 
    runs in O(|V|^3) time also.  For most graphs, the conversion
    will be much faster -- for example, a planar graph will be
    transformed for 4-coloring in linear time since |E| = O(|V|).
