    ALGORITHM:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Let $S = [0,-1; 1,0], T = [0,-1; 1,-1]$, and $I = [-1,0; 0,1]$.

           encode the relations

           $$
           There are about n such rows.
           The number of nonzero entries per row is at most 3*(k-1).
           Note that we must include rows for *all* i, since
           even if $[x_i] = [x_j]$, it need not be the case that
           $[x_i T] = [x_j T]$, since $S$ and $T$ do not commute.
           However, in many cases we have an a priori formula for the
           dimension of the quotient by all these relations, so we can
           omit many relations and just check that there are enough at
           the end---if there aren't, we add in more.
           
        \item Compute the reduced row echelon form of $A$ using sparse
           Gaussian elimination.
           
        \item Use what we've done above to read off a sparse matrix R
           that uniquely expresses each of the n Manin symbols in
           terms of a subset of Manin symbols, modulo the relations.
           This subset of Manin symbols is a basis for the quotient by

    Create the sparse relation matrix over $\Q$ for Manin symbols of
    given weight on $\Gamma_0(N)$, with given sign.
    
    INPUT:
        M -- manin_symbols.ManinSymbolList
        field -- base field
        weight -- the weight, an integer > 2
        sign -- element of [-1,0,1]

    OUTPUT:
        A -- a SparseMatrix that gives the 2-term and 3-term relations
             between Manin symbols.

    MORE DETAILS:
    \begin{enumerate}
       \item Create an empty sparse matrix.

        \item Let $S = [0,-1; 1,0]$, $T = [0,-1; 1,-1]$, $I = [-1,0; 0,1]$.

        \item Enter the $T$ relations:      
                 $$  x + x*T = 0  $$
           Remove $x$ and $x T$ from reps to consider.

        \item If sign $\neq 0$, enter the I relations:
        $$
                   x + sign x I = 0.
        $$

        \item Enter the $S$ relations in the matrix:
           $$
                   x + x S + x S^2 = 0
           $$
           by putting 1's at cols corresponding to $x$, $x S$, and $x S^2$.
           Remove x from list of reps to consider.
