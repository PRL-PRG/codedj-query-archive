def install_scripts(bin_directory=None):
    r"""
    Run this command as \code{install_scripts(bin_directory)}
    to create scripts in the given bin directory
    that, independently of SAGE, run various software components
    included with SAGE:
      ['gap', 'gp', 'singular', 'maxima', 'M2', 'kash', 
              'mwrank', 'ipython', 'hg', 'hgmerge', 'R']

    This command:
    \begin{itemize}
       \item verbosely tell you which scripts it adds, and
       \item will \emph{not} overwrite any scripts you already
             have in the given bin directory.
    \end{itemize}
    
    INPUT:
        bin_directory -- string; the directory into which to
                         put the scripts
                         
    OUTPUT:
        Verbosely prints what it is doing and creates files
        in bin_directory that are world executable and readable.

    NOTE:
    You may need to run \sage as root in order to run
    \code{install_scripts} successfully, since the user
    running \sage will need write permissions on
    \code{bin_directory}.
