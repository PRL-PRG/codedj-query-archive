        AUTHOR: John Cremona

        NOTE: And finally...from what I remember of those gp programs,
        the algorithm I was using (which is not exactly the same as
        others use, for example it is not the same as described in
        Cohen's book) is entirely valid for general finite fields.  It
        would just be a question of replacing Mod(a,p) by the
        appropriate alternative.  As I understand it, pari has no
        trouble doing arithmetic over general finite fileds, with
        elements represented as Mod(a,b) where b is a suitable
        irreducible polynomial mod p; though the output format is hard
        to read then (usually improved by allying lift() twice).
 
        One word of warning though: the underlying algorithm is
        definitely *not* intended for use with *large* finite fields!
        For example, I would regard the factorization of the order of
        an element as inexpensive.
