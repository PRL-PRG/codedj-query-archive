#This is the backends package.
#Backends are a way to store permanently a project on a medium
# (like on the hard disk or on the internet)
#and to read projects from this medium
#
#Current backends are :
#
# localfile.py : store and read a local XML file
#
#
#
# this __init__.py should not be empty. It should list the available backends
