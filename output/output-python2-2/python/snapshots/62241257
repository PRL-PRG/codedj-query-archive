    enchant.utils:    Misc utilities for the enchant package
    
    This module provies miscellaneous utilities for use with the
    enchant spellchecking package.  Currently available functionality
    includes:
        
        * string/unicode compatability wrappers
        * functions for dealing with locale/language settings
        * ability to list supporting data files (win32 only)

#  Unicode/Bytes compatabilty wrappers.

#  These allow us to support both Python 2.x and Python 3.x from
#  the same codebase.

#  We provide explicit type objects "bytes" and "unicode" that can be
#  used to construct instances of the appropriate type.  The class
#  "EnchantStr" derives from the default "str" type and implements the
#  necessary logic for encoding/decoding as strings are passed into
#  the underlying C library (where they must always be utf-8 encoded
#  byte strings).

    This class encapsulate the logic for interfacing between python native
    string/unicode objects and the underlying enchant library, which expects
    all strings to be UTF-8 character arrays.  It is a subclass of the
    default string class 'str' - on Python 2.x that makes it an ascii string,
    on Python 3.x it is a unicode object.

    Initialise it with a string or unicode object, and use the encode() method
    to obtain an object suitable for passing to the underlying C library.
    When strings are read back into python, use decode(s) to translate them
    back into the appropriate python-level string type.

    This allows us to following the common Python 2.x idiom of returning
    unicode when unicode is passed in, and byte strings otherwise.  It also
    lets the interface be upwards-compatible with Python 3, in which string
    objects will be unicode by default.
