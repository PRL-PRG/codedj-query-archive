The Stein-Watkins table of elliptic curves.

SAGE gives access to the Stein-Watkins table of elliptic curves, via
an optional package that you must install.  This is a huge database of
elliptic curves.  You can download the database as a 2.6GB SAGE
package from \url{http://modular.ucsd.edu/sagedb/}, which you install
with the command
\begin{verbatim}
sage -i stein-watkins-ecdb.spkg
\end{verbatim}
You can also download a small version, without having to explicitly
download anything from a website, using the command
\begin{verbatim}
sage -i stein-watkins-ecdb-mini
\end{verbatim}

This database covers a wide range of conductors, but unlike
CremonaDatabase(), this database need not list all curves of a given
conductor.  It lists the curves whose coefficients aren't ``too
large'' (see [Stein-Watkins, Ants 5]).

\begin{itemize}
\item The command \code{SteinWatkinsAllData(n)} returns an iterator over
the curves in the $n$th Stein-Watkins table, which contains elliptic
curves of conductor between $n10^5$ and $(n+1)10^5$.  Here $n$ can be
between $0$ and $999$, inclusive.

\item The command \code{SteinWatkinsPrimeData(n)} returns an iterator over
the curves in the $n$th Stein-Watkins table, which contains prime conductor
elliptic curves of conductor between $n10^6$ and $(n+1)10^6$.  Here $n$
varies between $0$ and $99$, inclusive.
\end{itemize}


EXAMPLES:
We obtain the first table of elliptic curves.

    sage: d = SteinWatkinsAllData(0)
    sage: d
    Stein-Watkins Database a.0 Iterator

We type \code{d.next()} to get each isogeny
class of curves from \code{d}:
    sage: C = d.next()
    sage: C
    Stein-Watkins isogeny class of conductor 11
    sage: d.next()
    Stein-Watkins isogeny class of conductor 14
    sage: d.next()
    Stein-Watkins isogeny class of conductor 15

An isogeny class has a number of attributes that give data about the
isogeny class, such as the rank, equations of curves, conductor, leading
coefficient of $L$-function, etc.
    sage: C.data
    ['11', '[11]', '0', '0.253842', '25', '+*1']
    sage: C.curves
    [[[0, -1, 1, 0, 0], '(1)', '1', '5'],
     [[0, -1, 1, -10, -20], '(5)', '1', '5'],
     [[0, -1, 1, -7820, -263580], '(1)', '1', '1']]
    sage: C.conductor
    11
    sage: C.leading_coefficient
    '0.253842'
    sage: C.modular_degree
    '+*1'
    sage: C.rank
    0
    sage: C.isogeny_number
    '25'

If we were to continue typing \code{d.next()} we would iterate over
all curves in the Stein-Watkins database up to conductor $10^5$.
We could also type \code{for C in d: ...}

To access the data file starting at $10^5$ do the following:

    sage: d = SteinWatkinsAllData(1)
    sage: C = d.next()
    sage: C
    Stein-Watkins isogeny class of conductor 100002
    sage: C.curves
    [[[1, 1, 0, 112, 0], '(8,1,2,1)', 'X', '2'],
     [[1, 1, 0, -448, -560], '[4,2,1,2]', 'X', '2']]

Next we access the prime-conductor data:

    sage: d = SteinWatkinsPrimeData(0)
    sage: C = d.next()
    sage: C
    Stein-Watkins isogeny class of conductor 11

Each call \code{d.next()} gives another elliptic curve of prime conductor:
    sage: C = d.next()
    sage: C
    Stein-Watkins isogeny class of conductor 17
    sage: C.curves
    [[[1, -1, 1, -1, 0], '[1]', '1', '4'],
     [[1, -1, 1, -6, -4], '[2]', '1', '2x'],
     [[1, -1, 1, -1, -14], '(4)', '1', '4'],
     [[1, -1, 1, -91, -310], '[1]', '1', '2']]
    sage: C = d.next()
    sage: C
    Stein-Watkins isogeny class of conductor 19
