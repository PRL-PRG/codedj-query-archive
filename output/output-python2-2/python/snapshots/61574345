    r"""
    Start the SAGE Notebook server. 

    INPUT:
        directory  -- (default: 'sage_notebook') directory that contains
                      the SAGE notebook files
        port       -- (default: 8000), port to serve the notebook on
        address    -- (default: 'localhost'), address to listen on
        port_tries -- (default: 0), number of additional ports to try if the
                      first one doesn't work (*not* implemented)
        secure     -- (default: True) if True use https so all
                      communication, e.g., logins and passwords,
                      between web browsers and the SAGE notebook is
                      encrypted (via GNU TLS).  *Highly recommended!*
        reset      -- (default: False) if True allows you to set the
                      admin password.  Use this if you forget your
                      admin password.
        accounts   -- (default: False) if True, any visitor to the website
                      will be able to create a new account.  If False,
                      only the admin can create accounts (currently, this
                      can only be done by running with accounts=True for
                      a few minutes, or on the command line with, e.g., 
                          nb = load('sage_notebook/nb.sobj')
                          nb.set_accounts(True)
                          nb.add_user("username", "password", "email@place", "user")
                          nb.save()
        open_viewer -- (default: True) whether to pop up a web browser.
                      You can override the default browser by setting
                      the SAGE_BROWSER environment variable, e.g., by putting
                         export SAGE_BROWSER="firefox"
                      in the file .bashrc in your home directory.
        timeout    -- (default: 0) seconds until idle worksheet sessions
                      automatically timeout, i.e., the corresponding
                      Sage session terminates.  0 means 'never timeout'.
        server_pool -- list;   The server_pool option specifies that worksheet processes run
                      as a separate user (chosen from the list in the server_pool -- see below).
                      
    \begin{verbatim}

    NOTE: If you have problems with the server certificate hostname not
    matching, do \code{notebook.setup()}.
    
    EXAMPLES:

    1. I just want to run the SAGE notebook.  Type

             notebook()

    2. I want to run the SAGE notebook server on a remote machine
       and be the only person allowed to log in.  Type

         notebook(address="address.of.remote.machine")

       the first time you do this you'll be prompted to set
       an administrator password.  Use this to login.
       NOTE: You may have to run notebook.setup() again and change
       the hostname.

    3. I just want to run the server locally on my laptop at a coffee
       shop with no wifi and do not want to be bothered with SSL,
       accounts, etc., and I am *absolutely certain* I am the only
       user logged into my laptop so I do not have to worry about
       somebody else using the notebook on localhost and deleting my
       files.  Use
 
                  notebook(secure=False)

    4. I want to create a SAGE notebook server that is open to anybody
       in the world to create new accounts, etc.  To run the SAGE
       notebook publically (1) at a minimu run it from a chroot jail
       (see the SAGE install guide), and (2) use a command like
    
         notebook(address="address.of.remote.machine",  
            server_pool=['sage1@localhost'], ulimit='-v 500000', accounts=True)

       The server_pool option specifies that worksheet processes run
       as a separate user.  The ulimit option restricts the memory
       available to each worksheet processes to 500MB.  See help on
       the accounts option above.

       Be sure to make that the sage_notebook/nb.sobj and contents
       of sage_notebook/backups is chmod og-rwx, i.e., only readable
       by the notebook process, since otherwise any user can read
       nb.sobj, which contains user email addresses and account
       information (password are stored hashed, so less worries there). 


    INPUT:  (more advanced)

    NOTE: The values of these two properties default to what they were
    last time the notebook command was called.
    
        server_pool -- (default: None), if given, should be a list like 
                      ['sage1@localhost', 'sage2@localhost'], where
                      you have setup ssh keys so that typing
                         ssh sage1@localhost
                      logs in without requiring a password, e.g., by typing
                      as the notebook server user
                          cd; ssh-keygen -t rsa
                      then put ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub as the file .ssh/authorized_keys2.
                      Note -- you have to get the permissions of files
                      and directories just right -- do a web search
                      for more details.
                      
        ulimit      -- (default: None -- leave as is), if given and server_pool is also given,
                      the worksheet processes are run with these constraints.
                      See the ulimit documentation. Common options include:
                           -f   The maximum size of files created by the shell
                           -t   The maximum amount of cpu time in seconds. 
                           -u   The maximum number of processes available to a single user. 
                           -v   The maximum amount of virtual memory available to the process.
                      Values are in 1024-byte increments, except for `-t', which is in seconds.
                      Example:  ulimit="-v 400000 -t 30"
