""" User configuration file for IPython

This is a more flexible and safe way to configure ipython than *rc files
(ipythonrc, ipythonrc-pysh etc.)

This file is always imported on ipython startup. You should import all the
ipython extensions you need here (see IPython/Extensions directory).

Feel free to edit this file to customize your ipython experience. If 
you wish to only use the old config system, it's perfectly ok to make this file 
empty.

# Most of your config files and extensions will probably start with this import

from IPython import ipapi
ip = ipapi.get()
import os

o = ip.options()
# autocall 1 ('smart') is default anyway, this is just an 
# example on how to set an option
o.autocall = 1

if o.profile == 'pysh':
    # Jason Orendorff's path class is handy to have in user namespace
    # if you are doing shell-like stuff
    try:
        ip.ex("from path import path" )
    except ImportError:
        pass
    
# Uncomment these lines to get pysh-like prompt for all profiles. 

#o.prompt_in1= '\C_LightBlue[\C_LightCyan\Y1\C_LightBlue]\C_Green|\#> '
#o.prompt_in2= '\C_Green|\C_LightGreen\D\C_Green> '
#o.prompt_out= '<\#> '

# make 'd' an alias for ls -F

ip.magic('alias d ls -F --color=auto')

# Make available all system commands through "rehashing" immediately. 
# You can comment these lines out to speed up startup on very slow 
# machines, and to conserve a bit of memory. Note that pysh profile does this
# automatically

#if os.name=='posix':
#    ip.magic('rehash')
#else:
#    #slightly slower, but better results esp. with Windows
#    ip.magic('rehashx')
