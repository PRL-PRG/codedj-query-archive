# Test the frozen module defined in frozen.c.
# Currently test_frozen fails:
#   Implementing pep3102(keyword only argument) needs changes in
#   code object, which needs modification to marshal.
#   However, to regenerate hard-coded marshal data in frozen.c,
#   we need to run Tools/freeze/freeze.py, which currently doesn't work
#   because Lib/modulefinder.py cannot handle relative module import
#   This test will keep failing until Lib/modulefinder.py is fixed
