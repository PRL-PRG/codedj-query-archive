Infinity Ring

The infinity ``ring'' is the set of two elements
\begin{verbatim}
        * infinity
        * A number less than infinity
\end{verbatim}

This isn't really a ring, but a formal construction that is incredibly
useful in much of the implementation of SAGE.

The rules for arithmetic are that the infinity ring does not canonically
coerce to any other ring, and all other rings canonically coerce to
the infinity ring, sending all elements to the single element
``a number less than infinity'' of the infinity ring.
Arithmetic and comparisons then takes place in the infinity ring,
where all arithmetic operations that are well defined are defined.

EXAMPLES:
We fetch the infinity ring and create some elements:
    sage: P = InfinityRing(); P
    The Infinity Ring
    sage: P(5)
    A number less than infinity
    sage: P.ngens()
    1
    sage: oo = P.0; oo
    Infinity

We compare finite numbers with infinity. 
    sage: 5 < oo
    True
    sage: 5 > oo
    False
    sage: oo < 5
    False
    sage: oo > 5
    True

We do arithmetic. 
    sage: oo + 5
    Infinity
    
Note that many operations are not defined, since the result is
not well defined. 
    sage: oo/0
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ArithmeticError: quotient of oo by number < oo not defined
    
What happened above is that 0 is canonically coerced to
"a number less than infinity" in the infinity ring, and the quotient
is then not well defined.
    
    sage: 0/oo
    A number less than infinity
    sage: oo * 0
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ArithmeticError: oo times smaller number not defined

    sage: oo/oo
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ArithmeticError: oo / oo not defined
