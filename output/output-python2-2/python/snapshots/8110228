# TODO:

# Things are going to get a lot messier when we have more inflection,
# because this is all string based.  Consider replacing "n1" etc in
# the regular expressions with variables that expand out to all
# of the different inflected possibilities, especially for the filters
# that are not concerned with inflection per se.

# A lot of these have things in common.  Consider defining classes
# for the shared properties and then instances for the differences.
# ... depends on how flexible the class system is.  Multiple inheritance?...

# Some (many?) of these assume that the lts are fully specified for the
# things they care about (e.g., neg-aff-only-1 and neg-adv-only-2), which
# will give different behavior from the grammar starts for underspecified
# lts...

# Language-type specific filters for word order.  Note that these
# apply to all sentences, not just the ones with 'wo' mrs_tags,
# because all sentences have word order!
#
# Each filter provides a list of feature-value pairs from language
# type definitions that it cares about.
#
# When the constraint is an 'or' (e.g., 'word-order' is ''sov'' or ''osv'')
# we put both 'word-order':'sov' and 'word-order':'osv' on the list.  The
# query which generates the gold standard test suites looks for all
# filters which match the particulare feature-value pairs for the language
# type in question.
