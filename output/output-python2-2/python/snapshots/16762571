Trade inventory.

This module provides a very flexible inventory object, used to maintain position
and to calculate P+L for a positions, for a single product. In order to compute
P+L, we need to book current trades with past trades, and our inventory object
supports various booking methods to select which positions get booked (FIFO,
LIFO, custom), and a few ways to price the booked positions (real, average
cost). It can also support manual booking of specific trades, in case an
external booking algorithm already takes place.

Note that to avoid precision errors, all prices are expressed as integers scaled
to 10^8.

(We have intended to make this object as flexible as possible, because this is a
generic problem that tends to be badly solved in the financial industry with
error-prone and confusing calculations, and can easily be solved once and for
all.)
