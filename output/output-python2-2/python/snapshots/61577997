SAGE Interface to the HG/Mercurial Revision Control System

These functions make setup and use of source control with SAGE easier, using
the distributed Mercurial HG source control system.  To learn about Mercurial,
see http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/. 

This system should all be fully usable from the SAGE notebook (except
for merging, currently).
This system should all be mostly from the SAGE notebook.

\begin{itemize}
\item Use \code{hg_sage.record()} to record all of your changes.
\item Use \code{hg_sage.bundle('filename')} to bundle them up to send them.
\item Use \code{hg_sage.inspect('filename.hg')} to inspect a bundle.
\item Use \code{hg_sage.unbundle('filename.hg')} to import a bundle into your
      repository.
\item Use \code{hg_sage.pull()} to synchronize with the latest official
      stable SAGE changesets. 
\end{itemize}

        - SSH requires an accessible shell account on the destination machine

        - path is relative to the remote user's home directory by default.
          Use an extra slash at the start of a path to specify an absolute path:
            ssh://example.com//tmp/repository
        - Mercurial doesn't use its own compression via SSH; the right thing
          to do is to configure it in your ~/.ssh/ssh_config, e.g.:
            Host *.mylocalnetwork.example.com
              Compression off
            Host *
              Compression on
          Alternatively specify "ssh -C" as your ssh command in your hgrc or
          with the --ssh command line option.
