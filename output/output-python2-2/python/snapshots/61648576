p-Adic Extension Rings

DESCRIPTION:

Extensions of $\Z_p$ are implemented as polynomials over $\Z_p$.
Given a polynomial to generate the extension, we use the Round4
Algorithm to find an unramified and totally ramified polynomial
which together generate the required extension.

    Base class for extensions of Z_p.

    As of right now, implemented in the simplest way possible:
    we just take a polynomial and a ring, and return the polynomial
    quotient ring, after checking that the defining polynomial is
    irreducible.

    TODO:
    We should use the Round4 algorithm to break the given
    polynomial into a totally ramified and unramified part, and
    create two subextensions, so that the whole extension is
    given as a tower.
