#  * The solve method is now a generator (i.e. yields)
#  * Added a function which takes a Sage matrix and solves
#    the exact cover problem for it.

# DLXMatrix class is used to store and solve an exact cover problem
# with help of Dancing Links [1] technique by Donald Knuth. The
# problem can be stated as an attempt to leave out rows of a 0/1
# matrix until remaining matrix has exactly one 1 in each column.
# Knuth proposes a fast solution technique based on clever trick with
# double linked list.
#
# This implementation will return row numbers of the solution instead
# column indexes (like in the Knuth's paper).
