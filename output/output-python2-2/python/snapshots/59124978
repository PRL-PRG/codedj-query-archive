"""

"Detail" RowAttributes reimplemented.  Details are used to "access a
Pointer from the other side".  If Table.addPointer() is called with
the "detailName" argument, then the other Table (the one where the
Pointer points to) will get a row method with that name.

For example, a NATIONS instance has a mathod cities() which returns a
pre-build query of CITIES from this nation.
